<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FULL SPEED FOR FOUR CORNERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Four straight country roads running at right
angles. You cannot see where they begin because
they have their beginning &#8220;over the hills
and far away,&#8221; but you can see where they end
at &#8220;Four Corners,&#8221; the hub of that universe,
for there stand the general store, which is also
the postoffice, the &#8220;tavern,&#8221; as it is called in
that part of the world, the church, the rectory,
and perhaps a dozen private dwellings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four Corners&#8221; is oddly mis-named, because
there are no corners there at all. It is a
circle. Maybe it was originally four corners,
but today it is certainly a circle with a big open
space in the center, and in the very middle of
that stands a flag staff upon which floats the
stars and stripes. The whole open space is
covered with the softest green turf. <i>Not</i> a
lawn, mind you, such as one may see in almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
any immaculately kept northern town, with
artistic flower beds dotting it, and a carefully
trimmed border of foliage plants surrounding it.
No, this circle has real Virginia turf; the thick,
rich, indestructible turf one finds in England,
which, as an old gardener told the writer, &#8220;we
rolls and tills it for a thousand years.&#8221; Nature
had been rolling and tilling this green plot of
ground for a good many thousand years.
</p>
<p>The circle was encompassed by an iron rail
fence to which the people from the surrounding
community hitched their saddle or carriage
horses when they came to the &#8220;Store&#8221; for their
mail, or to make various purchases. And there
the beasties often stood for hours, rubbing noses
and exchanging the gossip of the paddocks, horse
(or mule) fashion.
</p>
<p>There were always several hitched there, and
they were always gossiping or dozing as they
waited for their owners to start toward home,
and they represented all sorts and conditions
of their kind just as those owners represented
all sorts and conditions of men. Some were
young men, some middle-aged, some old. Some
were of the gentry of the surrounding country,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
some the humbler white folk, some the negroes
who had managed to acquire small tracts of land
which they farmed successfully or otherwise.
Among them, too, was the typical shiftless,
&#8220;triflin&#8217; no-&#8217;count&#8221; darkey who &#8220;jist sits &#8217;round
a-waitin&#8217;,&#8221; though it would be hard for him to
tell what he was waiting for.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the &#8220;Corners&#8221; is the center of
the activities of that community, though to
make those who most frequently gather there,
comprehend the limitations of its activities they
would have to be set down in the midst of some
big, hustling city.
</p>
<p>Still, some who go to the Corners are very
much alive to this fact, for they have journeyed
throughout the length and breadth of their own
land and many other lands beside. But they
do not tell their less travelled brothers much of
the wonders which lie beyond the towering
mountains, which is just as well, perhaps.
The stay-at-home might be less happy and content
were they to learn of the doings of the big
world beyond the barriers of their snug, peaceful
valley, which seems to the wiser ones so far
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
away from the trials, struggles, and worries of
the world beyond.
</p>
<p>And, curiously enough, when those of wider
knowledge return to the valley they find again
the peace and tranquility which they left there,
and, breathing a sigh of relief, settle back into
its restful atmosphere, and tranquil content, as
one settles into a comfortable old chair.
</p>
<p>The nearest &#8220;real, sure-enough town&#8221; to
the Corners is Sprucy Branch and that is fourteen
miles from Luray, with its famous caverns.
To reach Sprucy Branch from Four Corners one
must drive or ride &#8220;a right smart distance,&#8221; and
then to reach Luray take a railway trip or drive
the fourteen miles. It is a beautiful part of this
big world, and the valley is a happy one. Moreover,
it would be hard to find a more delightful,
little social world than its gentlefolk represent.
Not the formal, artificial, rigidly conventional
social world of the big northern cities, where few
have time or inclination to be absolutely genuine,
but the rare, true social life of the well-bred
southerner, to whom friendship means much,
kinship more, and family ties everything. Whose
sons go forth into the world to make their mark,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
and often their fortunes, too, yet still retain the
charm of their up-bringing, the traditions of
their families, and their intense love of &#8220;the
home back yonder.&#8221; Whose daughters, though
brought up, &#8220;raised,&#8221; they often say, in the
simplicity of country life, and more often than
not having very limited financial resources, are
in the truest sense of that beautiful old word,
the gentlewomen we picture, prepared to grace
their homes, or the outer world and reflect credit
upon the land of their birth. And this is the conviction
of her northern sister, the first of nine
generations to be born beyond the borders of
the old Bay State, so she can hardly be accused
of a biased opinion.
</p>
<p>And this lovely September morning, when the
air holds just the faintest suggestion of autumn,
when the leaves are beginning to hint of richer
tints than the soft greens which they have worn
all summer, when the native birds are hobnobbing
and gossiping with their friends who are
journeying farther south, &#8220;All the news of the
north to the sunny south bringing,&#8221; and the
squirrels are chattering and scolding as they
gather their hoard of chinkapins and other fodder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
for the long winter at hand, something is
stirring. Yes, stirring vigorously, too, if one
may judge by the hullabaloo which suddenly
arises far down the East Pike. The people
gathered upon the porch at the store prick up
their ears to listen. There are a dozen or more
there upon one errand or another, for the store
is the commercial center of the district, and
from it can be bought or ordered every nameable
thing under the sun. It is also the postoffice,
so, once, at least, each day there wends his or
her way to it, every human being who expects,
hopes for, or by any chance may receive a
letter.
</p>
<p>It was mail time. Hence the number of
people gathered about to prick up their ears as
the racket down the road grew louder and louder
each second, and the thud of horses&#8217; hoofs, the
shouts of boys&#8217; voices and a girl&#8217;s ringing laugh
were borne to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder comes the Woodbine bunch, I&#8217;ll
bet a dollar, and they&#8217;re sure enough a-hittin&#8217;
it up, too. Reckon that young one of the old
Admiral&#8217;s is a-settin&#8217; the pace, too. She&#8217;s a
clipper, all right,&#8221; commented a man seated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
upon a tilted-back chair, his hat pushed far back
upon his shock head. He was guiltless of coat,
and his jean trousers were hitched high about
his waist by a pair of wool suspenders.
</p>
<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking when three
horses came pounding into view, the leader
ridden by a girl about fifteen years of age. The
animal was a little mouse-colored beastie with
white markings and eyes which gave a pretty
strong hint of a good bit of broncho disposition
to which the markings also pointed. He was
lithe and agile as a cat and moved with something
of the sinuous gliding of that animal,
rather than the bounding motions of his eastern-bred
mates. The two horses running neck and
neck behind him were evidently blooded animals,
and all three were a-lather from the pace set by
their leader, all mud-bespattered to the point of
being wholly disreputable, for a shower the previous
night had left many a wide puddle in the
road.
</p>
<p>The girl leading rode as only a southern girl,
accustomed to a saddle all her life, can ride.
The saddle was of the Mexican type, but the
headstall was the lightest possible, with a simple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
snaffle bit, even that seeming almost superfluous
for she guided her mount more by the
motions of her body than the bridle. She held
the reins at arm&#8217;s length in her left hand, while
with her right she waved above her head a soft
felt hat, her banner of defiance and derision of
her pursuers. Swaying ever so slightly in her
saddle, she brought her wiry little mount up to
the platform, and slid from his back as snow
slides from a hillside. The reins were tossed
over his head and the race was ended.
</p>
<p>Running across the porch she nodded or
bowed comprehensively to all seated or standing
upon it&mdash;the greeting accompanied by a sunny,
happy smile which revealed faultlessly pretty
teeth.
</p>
<p>As she disappeared within the store her
friends came rushing up to the platform, shouting
after her as they drew up their horses:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, come back! Hold on! That&#8217;s no
fair, even if you did beat. <i>We&#8217;re</i> going to decide
the kind of candy. You&#8217;ll do us out of our last
cent if we let you get it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! Why not?&#8221; was called back,
banteringly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m going to run Apache off
his legs, risk breaking my neck and then not
have the say-so in the end? I reckon not.
It&#8217;s just <i>got</i> to be chocolates <i>this</i> time. Cinnamon
suckers are all right enough for a little
race, but this was a two-mile go-it-for-all-you&#8217;re-worth
one, and besides, you&#8217;d better be nice to
me, while you have the chance, because you
won&#8217;t have me with you very much longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, cut that out. We know it well enough.
You needn&#8217;t rub it in,&#8221; was the chorus of
answers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Bev,&#8221; added the taller of the two
boys, a fair haired lad of sixteen or seventeen.
He was a handsome boy, with eyes of such a
deep blue that they seemed violet, wavy golden
hair and a fine, clear skin, though it was tanned
many shades darker than nature intended it to
be. The nose was clean cut, and the mouth
and chin indicated considerable strength of
character. He carried himself as though very
sure of his place in the world, and his intention
to hold it. Nevertheless, the face was a cheery,
happy one.
</p>
<p>The other boy was so like the girl that it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
was laughable. Exchange their garments and
it would have puzzled the cleverest person to
tell &#8220;t&#8217;other-from-which.&#8221; To label them twins
would have been superfluous. Nature had attended
to that little matter fifteen years earlier
in their lives, and even their old mammy used to
say: &#8220;Now don&#8217; none of yo&#8217; other chillern go
ter projectin&#8217; wid dem babies whilst I&#8217;s got my
haid turn&#8217;d &#8217;way, cause if yo&#8217; does dey&#8217;s gwine
fer to get mixed pintedly, an&#8217; den I&#8217;s gwine ter
have ter spend a hull hour mebbe a-gettin&#8217; my
mind settled pon which is which again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Moreover, the fifteen years of daily association
had only served to consummate what Dame
Nature had so ably begun, for the girl and the
boy almost thought and felt in unison. In all
those years they had hardly been separated for a
day. That is no further than a strict quarantine
beneath the same roof had separated them, and
that had been entirely Beverly&#8217;s doings. At
five she began the performance by contracting
whooping-cough; at seven she tried mumps;
at nine turned a beautiful lobster hue from
measles, and at eleven capped the climax by
scaring the family nearly to death with scarlet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
fever, and thereby causing her grandfather,
Admiral Ashby, to exclaim:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord bless my soul, Beverly, you are
worse than the potato bugs; they <i>do</i> skip the
fatal second year now and again, but you never
let up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Perhaps this criticism had called a halt in
her performances in the line of contagious
diseases, for since the scarlet fever scare she had
quit frightening the family into spasms, and at
fifteen was as charming, healthy, and tantalizing
a bit of girlhood as one could wish to see,
though about as much of a tomboy as one could
find.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>WOODBINE</h3>
</div>

<p>While Beverly Ashby is squabbling good-naturedly
with her brother and chum, suppose
we take this opportune moment in which to
learn something about the trio?
</p>
<p>Beverly and her brother, Athol, had elected
to enter this world exactly fifteen years and
four months prior to the opening of this story.
They also chose the thirteenth of May, 1897,
to spring their first surprise upon their family
by arriving together, and had managed to sustain
their reputations for surprising the grownups
by never permitting a single year to pass
without some new outbreak, though it must be
admitted that Beverly could certainly claim
the greater distinction of the two in that direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodbine,&#8221; their home, had been the family
seat for many generations. It had seen many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
a Seldon enter this world and many a one depart
from it. It had witnessed the outgoing
of many brides from its broad halls, and seen
many enter to become its mistress. It was a
wonderful old place, beautiful, stately, and so
situated upon its wooded upland that it commanded
a magnificent view of the broad valley
of Sprucy Stream. Over against it lay the
foothills of the blue, blue mountains, the Blue
Ridge range, and far to the westward the peaks
of the Alleghanies peeped above the Massanutton
range nearer at hand.
</p>
<p>The valley itself was like a rare painting.
The silvery stream running through the foreground,
the rich woodlands and fertile fields,
the marvelous lights and shadows ever holding
the one looking upon it entranced. And all
this lay before the broad acres of Woodbine, so
named because that graceful vine hung in rich
festoons from every column, gallery, portico
and even the eaves to which it had climbed, a
delicate gray-green adornment in early spring,
a rich, darker tone in midsummer, and a gorgeous
crimson in the autumn.
</p>
<p>It was a spacious old mansion and would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
have been considered a large one even in the
north, where, during the past fifty years, palaces
have sprung into existence under the misnomer
of &#8220;cottages.&#8221; Happily, it did not tower up
into the air as many of the so-called cottages do,
but spread itself comfortably over the greensward,
the central building being the only one
ambitious enough to attain to two stories and a
sharply peaked roof, in which were set several
dormer windows from which a most entrancing
view of the valley and distant mountain ranges
could be obtained.
</p>
<p>These dormer window chambers were rarely
used, and, excepting during the semi-annual
house cleaning, rarely visited. That one of
these rare visits should have been paid one of
them upon this particular day of which we are
writing was simply Kismet. But of that a
little later. Let us finish our picture of lovely
Woodbine.
</p>
<p>Across the entire front of the main floor as
well as the second story, ran a wide piazza,
gallery they call it in that part of the country.
The lower gallery gave upon a broad, velvety
lawn dotted with elms, beeches, oaks and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
feathery pines. No path led to this gallery,
and when one stepped from it one&#8217;s feet sank
into the softest green turf. The door which
opened upon it fairly spoke hospitality and
welcome from its beautiful fan-like arch to its
diamond-paned side lights and the hall within
was considered one of the more perfect specimens
of the architecture of its period to be
found in the state, as was the stately circular
double stairway leading to the floor above.
Half way up, upon a broad landing, a stained
glass window, brought long, long ago from
England, let the western sunlight filter through
its richly tinted panes and lie in patches of
exquisite color upon polished stairs and floor.
</p>
<p>At the north and south ends of the house
were the real entrances from the carefully raked,
wide driveway which described almost a complete
circle from the great stone gateway half
a mile across Woodbine&#8217;s lawn. Could this
driveway have run straight through the house
the circle would have been perfect, but it had
to stop at the big south portico, with its graceful
columns, and resume its sweep from the north
one which gave upon the &#8220;office,&#8221; the overseer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
cottage, the various buildings devoted to the
business &#8220;ob de gr&#8217;et house,&#8221; as the darkies
called it, and away further to the stables, carriage
house, granaries and other buildings of the
estate, with the servants&#8217; cabins behind these.
All upon the north side of Woodbine was devoted
to the practical, utilitarian needs of the
place, all upon its southern to its pleasures and
luxuries, for in the buildings circling away from
the south end were the spacious kitchens, dairy,
smoke house, laundry and other buildings necessary
to the domestic economy of the household.
None of these buildings touched directly upon
the main house, but were connected with it by
a roofed-over colonnade upon which the woodbine
ran riot, as it did upon all the detached
buildings, producing an effect charming beyond
description. The colonnades described a semicircle
from the north-west and south-west
corners of the big house, and led from the
kitchen to the big dining room, and from the
office to the Admiral&#8217;s study. All the buildings
were constructed of rich red brick, brought from
England generations ago, the pillars being of
white marble. The effect against the dark
green foliage was picturesque to agreed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>Unlike many of the old southern homes,
Woodbine had always been kept in perfect
repair, and by some miracle of good fortune,
had escaped the ravages of the Civil War. Its
present owner, Admiral Athol Seldon, enjoyed
a very comfortable income, having been wise
enough during the troublous times of the war
to invest his fortune where it would be reasonably
safe. He would not have been called a
wealthy man, as wealth is gauged in the great
northern cities, but in this peaceful valley,
where needs were simple and diversions sensible,
he was regarded as a man of affluence and no
little importance.
</p>
<p>During the war he had served in the Confederate
Navy, and served with all the strength
of his convictions. When it ended in a lost
cause he returned to Woodbine to learn in what
condition the home he so loved had come through
the conflict, for it was situated in the very
vortex of the disturbance. Finding it but
slightly harmed, and having sufficient means
to repair it, he resolved to end his days there.
He had never married, an early romance having
come to a tragic end in the death of his fiancee
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
soon after the outbreak of the war. Consequently,
beautiful Woodbine lacked a mistress,
to the great distress of the old family servants.
</p>
<p>To remedy this he sent for his brother&#8217;s widow
and her little two-year-old daughter, Mary.
Beverly Seldon, two years his brother&#8217;s junior,
had been killed at the battle of Winchester in
1864, and the little Mary had entered this world
exactly five months after her father&#8217;s death.
Her mother came very near following her father
into the great beyond, but survived the shock
to live beneath Athol Seldon&#8217;s hospitable roof
until Mary was eleven years of age, then quietly
went to sleep, leaving Mary to her uncle&#8217;s care.
The child then and there became mistress not
only of Woodbine, but of every living thing
upon the place, her uncle included, and no only
daughter could have been cared for, petted,
spoiled or spanked more systematically than
the Madcap Mary Seldon.
</p>
<p>At twenty-six she married Turner Ashby,
the grandson of one of the Admiral&#8217;s oldest
friends. Two years later a little daughter was
born, but died before she was a year old. Then,
just when the old Admiral was beginning to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
grumble because there seemed to be no prospect
of a grand-nephew to inherit Woodbine, Mary
Ashby presented him with not only an heir
but an heiress as well, and the old gentleman
came very near a balloon ascension.
</p>
<p>The twins were christened Athol Seldon
Ashby and Beverly Turner Ashby before they
had fully decided that they were really American
citizens, and for seven years no happier household
could have been found in the state. Then
another calamity visited it. Turner Ashby was
killed in a railway accident while north on a
business trip. It was a frightful blow to the
home in which he was adored by every member,
from the Admiral straight down to the blackest
little piccaninny upon the estate, and to make it,
if possible, more tragic, all that ever came back
to Woodbine was the seal ring he had worn,
picked up in the charred ruins of the parlor
coach. More than eight years had passed since
that tragedy, and those years had changed
Mary Ashby from a light-hearted, happy young
wife and joyous mother to a quiet, dignified
woman. Never again did her children find in
her the care-free, romping play-fellow they had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
always known, though she never ceased to be
the gentle, tender mother.
</p>
<p>And how they missed it. They were too
young to fully appreciate their loss, though they
grieved deeply for the tall, handsome, golden-haired,
blue-eyed father who had been their
jolly comrade, riding, romping with them, rowing,
playing all manner of games, and always
ready to relate some thrilling tale, and who,
after eleven years of married life, had remained
as much their mother&#8217;s lover as upon the day he
married her. Indeed, all the countryside
mourned for Turner Ashby, for such a personality
could not be snatched from its environment
without leaving a terrible blank for many
years.
</p>
<p>Athol was like him in character, but not the
least in personal appearance, for both children
were Seldon from the crowns of their dark
heads to the tips of their small feet. Their
chum, and inseparable companion, Archie Carey,
might more readily have been taken for Turner
Ashby&#8217;s son: he was so tall, fair-haired and
blue-eyed. Two years their senior and living
upon the adjacent estate of &#8220;Uplands,&#8221; he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
grown up in an uninterrupted companionship
with Athol and Beverly, and was regarded by
them very much as an elder brother so far as
camaraderie went, though by no means accorded
an older brother&#8217;s privileges by Miss
Beverly. Indeed, she was more often the leading
spirit in the fun, frolics or scrapes into
which they were constantly plunging, as for
example the one alluded to in the opening
chapter. But that must have a chapter all to
itself.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>FROM THE DORMER WINDOW</h3>
</div>

<p>Woodbine, as has been said, lay about two
miles from Four Corners, the road leading to
the post office clearly visible for almost its
entire length.
</p>
<p>It had always been the custom at Woodbine
and Uplands to send to Four Corners twice
daily for the mail, the children as a rule doing
the errand and only too glad of the diversion,
for they never failed to hear some bit of neighborhood
gossip at the post office, or meet friends
from some of the adjacent estates. Moreover,
there was invariably the speculation regarding
the writers of the letters taken from the box
even when the letters were addressed to other
members of their respective families, for neither
Beverly, Athol or Archie had extensive correspondence
with the world beyond the mountains.
Just now, however, a new and vital
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
interest had arisen, for after a grave family
conclave it had been definitely settled that the
time had arrived when Beverly and Athol must
break away from the old order of things and be
sent to boarding schools. Up to the present
time a governess or a tutor had taught their
young ideas to shoot, (straight or otherwise)
with Admiral Seldon as head of the discipline
department, a position by no means a sinecure
since Beverly represented one-half the need of
such a department. Until the children were
twelve the governess had been all sufficient but
at that point Athol rebelled at being &#8220;a sissy&#8221;
and demanded a tutor, Beverly entirely concurring
in his views. So a tutor had been installed
and had remained until the previous
July, when he was called to fill a more lucrative
position elsewhere. Thus Woodbine&#8217;s young
shoots were left without a trainer, to the dismay
of its older members and distress of its younger
ones, for both Beverly and Athol had grown very
fond of Norman Lee, who seemed but little
older than themselves, though in reality quite
ten years their senior. In the schoolroom he
had been the staid, dignified instructor but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
beyond its walls no better chum and comrade
could have been found. He was hale-fellow in
all their good times and frolics. Consequently
his resignation &#8220;just broke up the whole outfit,&#8221;
as Athol put it, and both children vowed
they wouldn&#8217;t have anybody else at Woodbine
because nobody else could ever be half so nice
as Norman Lee. Long before the three years
of his tutorship ended he had become &#8220;Norman&#8221;
to all the household, even the children adopting
the more familiar appellation beyond the schoolroom
doors, though within it the concession of
&#8220;Mr. Norman&#8221; was yielded, which secretly
amused the young tutor not a little, and often
caused him to wonder how the boy and girl
contrived to maintain the attitude so consistently
and with such perfect gravity. For four
hours of the day he might have been Methuselah&#8217;s
own brother from their standpoint but
upon the school-room&#8217;s threshold they dropped
as garments the relations of pupils and teacher
and became the best of good chums.
</p>
<p>It had been a singularly happy relation and
it was not surprising that it seemed to them
well-nigh impossible to renew it with an entire
stranger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>And truth to tell the Admiral and Mrs. Ashby
were not in the least sanguine of being able to
find any one else capable of repeating it and for
a time were a good deal daunted by the outlook
for the coming year.
</p>
<p>The previous year Archie Carey had gone
away to school and during his holidays had
come back to Uplands brimful of enthusiasm
and determined to have Athol join him. Athol
was quite as eager to do so, the one fly in his
ointment of pure joy being the thought of the
separation from Beverly, though boy-like, he
kept this fact deep buried in his heart. Nevertheless,
it made him feel queer when the
possibility of going upon divided ways to different
schools became a very definite one indeed.
The boy and girl were like a pair of horses which
has been driven together fifteen years and suddenly
separated. True, the separation was not
as yet a fact, but human beings can suffer more
in anticipation than the brute creation can in
reality. The great question at present was
which of many schools to select. Admiral
Seldon had written to several for circulars and
information, and had been nearly swamped with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
replies in every conceivable form. At length
he had weeded the mass down to three, entering
into more definite correspondence with these,
and the replies to his last letters were now being
eagerly awaited by Beverly, Athol and Archie.
The school now under most favorable consideration
for Beverly was about thirty-five miles
from Sprucy Branch, the town nearest Four
Corners and Woodbine.
</p>
<p>It was the coming of these letters which had
caused the excitement at Woodbine as the boys
and girl were about to go for the morning mail,
Athol upon his little thoroughbred, Royal,
Archie mounted upon his own handsome hunter,
Snowdrift, and Beverly on a wiry little broncho
which had been sent to her by an old friend of
the Admiral&#8217;s who had become the owner of a
ranche in Arizona. The friend had assured
Admiral Seldon that &#8220;Apache&#8221; had been &#8220;thoroughly
gentled,&#8221; and Beverly, who had never
known the meaning of fear from the hour she
could bestride a horse, had welcomed him with
delight. Whether the old Admiral had done
likewise is open to doubt, but Mrs. Ashby
frankly protested. As a girl <i>she</i> had ridden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
every ridable thing upon the place but it was
literally a horse of another color when it came
to the point of Beverly doing as she had done.
So Apache had been tolerated, not welcomed,
by Mrs. Ashby, and having been an eye-witness
to some of the little beast&#8217;s astonishing performances
when he first came two years before, she
has exacted from Beverly a promise to be very
cautious when riding him. Until his arrival
Beverly had ridden Jewel, her fourteen-hand
pony, and been quite content, but Jewel&#8217;s luster
was dimmed by Apache&#8217;s brilliant &#8220;shines,&#8221;
as old Uncle Abel called his cavortings when
feeling exceptionally fit from his unaccustomed
diet of oats and feed. Out in Arizona his food
had consisted of alfalfa grass with an occasional
&#8220;feed&#8221; thrown in, so it is not surprising that
the new order of high living somewhat intoxicated
him. But Apache had won his place at
Woodbine.
</p>
<p>As the young people were about to set forth
upon their two-mile trip for the mail Mrs. Ashby
warned:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Beverly be careful, dear. Apache has a
lively tickle in his toes this crisp morning, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
besides the roads are terribly muddy and slippery
from last night&#8217;s shower.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful mumsey dear,&#8221; answered the
girl, as she ran down the steps to spring upon her
mount.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful and <i>no</i> racing with the boys, remember,&#8221;
Mrs. Ashby called after her.
</p>
<p>Perhaps Beverly did not hear the concluding
admonition. At any rate we&#8217;ll give her the
benefit of the doubt, for at that moment Apache
gave testimony of the tickle in his toes by
springing straight up into the air in as good an
imitation of a &#8220;buck&#8221; as any &#8220;thoroughly
gentled&#8221; little broncho could give in the polite
society of his aristocratic Virginia cousins. Mrs.
Ashby gave a startled exclamation, but Beverly,
secure in her seat, waved a merry good-by and
was off after the boys who were calling to her
to &#8220;hurry up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course they had not heard one word of the
foregoing conversation. Had they done so it
is safe to say that they would never had proposed
the two-mile race to the post office nor tormented
Beverly for being &#8220;no sort of a sport,&#8221; and
&#8220;scared to back her painted plug against their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
thoroughbreds.&#8221; They were honorable lads
and would have felt honor-bound to respect Mrs.
Ashby&#8217;s wishes. But not having heard, they
gave Beverly &#8220;all that was coming to her for
riding a calico nag,&#8221; though said &#8220;nag&#8221; was
certainly a little beauty.
</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of the distance to Four
Corners had been ridden when Beverly&#8217;s temper,
never too elastic, snapped. Her riding crop
descended with a thwack, first upon Royal&#8217;s
round flank, then upon Snowdrift&#8217;s and finally
upon Apache&#8217;s side as she cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You-all hush up and <i>ride</i>. I&#8217;ll beat you to
Four Corners or die in the attempt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sudden onslaught brought the result to
be expected. The two thoroughbreds plunged
forward with snorts of indignant protest, answered
by Apache&#8217;s very plebian squeal of rage
as he shook his bony little head and struck
into a gait such as Beverly had never dreamed
a horse could strike. It was like a tornado let
loose, and, expert little horsewoman that she
was, she found ample occupation for all her wits
and equestrian skill, though she managed to jerk
out as she whirled past her companions:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two pounds of Huyler&#8217;s candy if I <i>do</i> beat
those giraffes of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hence the commotion at Four Corners a few
moments later, the whirlwind arrived and the
conversation recorded in the first chapter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Telford, have you got any Huyler
boxes?&#8221; asked the winner of the race, resting
her gauntleted hands and her riding crop upon
the counter. &#8220;These boys are trying to make
me take two pounds of cinnamon suckers on a
bet. Did you ever hear such nonsense? I
couldn&#8217;t eat them in a year and real, sure-enough
bets mean something better than
suckers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, Miss Bev&#8217;ly, I aint rightly knowin&#8217;
what kind o&#8217; lollypops is in them boxes, most
times folks jist helps theirselves an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
pay no &#8217;tention ter the brand. It&#8217;s all candy,
I reckon,&#8221; answered the shop keeper, drawing
two or three boxes from his case and placing
them upon his counter. From the appearance
of the wrappings they belied Huyler&#8217;s advertisement
of being &#8220;fresh every hour,&#8221; though one of
the boxes bore that firm&#8217;s name. The others
were stamped by Martha Washington, Lowney
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
and one or two other widely known manufacturers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes this one&#8217;s Huyler&#8217;s but I&#8217;ve got to have
<i>two</i> this time. Yes I have too! Athol&#8217;s got to
put up for one and you for the other. Why just
look at me! The mud on me ought to just
naturally make you both <i>want</i> to do something
to pay up for making me get into such a state.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t make you! You started the
circus,&#8221; protested her brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed if I&#8217;d do a thing for you if it wasn&#8217;t
likely to be the last race we&#8217;ll have in one while.
Look at <i>those</i>,&#8221; interjected Archie Carey, coming
over from the letter window where he had
gone to ask for the mail and slamming upon the
counter beside the boxes of candy half a dozen
plump letters. Three bore the addresses of the
schools under consideration. All three faces
grew sober.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet those will settle your hash Bev,&#8221;
was Athol&#8217;s comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, why couldn&#8217;t you have been a boy instead
of a girl anyhow,&#8221; protested Archie.
&#8220;Then you&#8217;d have come along with us as a
matter of course and our good times wouldn&#8217;t
have all been knocked into a cocked hat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s go home,&#8221; said Beverly
soberly, as she gathered up her boxes, nodded to
Mr. Telford, and took her mud-splashed self
from the store, the boys lingering to pay the
bill.
</p>
<p>She had remounted Apache when they joined
her, Archie carrying the letters which he stuffed
viciously into the mail-bag strapped to his
saddle. Then the two boys sprang upon their
waiting horses. As they rode in silence Beverly
glanced down at her khaki riding skirt and at
Apache&#8217;s mud-splashed body, and the next
moment had stopped short, exclaiming:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at us, and I promised mother I
wouldn&#8217;t race!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; exclaimed the boys in duet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did,&#8221; she repeated with a solemn nod.
</p>
<p>This was too much for her companions and
the woodland bordering the road echoed to
their shouts. When they had regained some
self-control Athol asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what are you going to do about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? I&#8217;m going to stop at the branch and
scrub some of this mud off Apache and myself,
for if we show up like this mother will think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
I&#8217;ve been acting ten times worse that I really
have, though goodness knows it&#8217;s bad enough as
it is. I didn&#8217;t mean to break my promise, but
I couldn&#8217;t let you boys put it all over me like
you did and not get back at you. Now get
out of the way while I clean up, and maybe you
could do a little on your own accounts and not
suffer for it either. &#8216;Snowdrift!&#8217; He looks
exactly like one after a spring thaw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys glanced at the beautiful white
horse and then at each other. The ensuing
fifteen minutes were spent in the vigorous grooming
of their steeds, Beverly scrubbing Apache
as energetically as Archie and Athol did Royal
and Snowdrift. Flat sticks served as scrapers
and bunches of dry grass for cloths. When the
animals looked a little less like animated mud
pies Beverly turned her attention to her riding
skirt. To restore that to its pristine freshness
might have daunted a professional scourer.
The more she rubbed and scrubbed the worse the
result and finally, when she was a sight from
alternate streaks of mud and wet splotches, she
sprang upon the startled Apache crying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along home quick! If I&#8217;ve got to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
face the music the quicker it&#8217;s done the better,&#8221;
and was off down the road in a fair way to being
as muddy when she reached Woodbine as she
was when she began her cleansing processes at
the branch, while up in one of the dormer
windows of the big house her mother stood
smiling to herself. It was one of the rare
occasions when she had occasion to go to that
room for some stored away winter clothing
against Beverly&#8217;s pending departure for boarding
school. As the riders resumed their homeward
journey she smiled and said softly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How exactly like Beverly. Now will come
confession and repentance and shall I be able to
keep a sober face?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>DIVIDED WAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I just forgot all about it, for of course
I wasn&#8217;t going to let the boys run me to death,
and oh, mother, Apache can get over the ground!
I never saw anything like the way he ran.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, neither have <i>I</i>,&#8221; replied Mrs. Ashby
significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; asked Beverly in surprise.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Ashby nodded though her lips twitched.
</p>
<p>Beverly&#8217;s face clouded and her lips set.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you see me?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the window of the north-east dormer
chamber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s dark eyes grew darker and signs
of a pending tempest lowered as she asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother did you go up there to spy upon me?
You almost <i>never</i> go into that room. Didn&#8217;t
you believe me? Did you think I had to be
watched? I think that was horrid, horrid of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
you. You know I didn&#8217;t mean to break my
word. I just forgot when the boys teased me
about my calico plug and <i>you</i> wouldn&#8217;t have
stood for that if you&#8217;d been in my place. You
just know you wouldn&#8217;t. You used to do
crazier things when you were a girl for Uncle
Athol has told me just dozens and dozens of
them. Why did you spy upon me? Why?
Why? I loathe being distrusted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The storm had burst with a vengeance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beverly hush and listen to me. If you will
pause a moment you will know perfectly well
that I had no idea of &#8216;spying&#8217; upon you. Have
I ever done so? You know better. It seems to
me you are displaying some doubt also. If I
did not know it to be the outcome of your
excitement I should decline to make any explanation.
As it is I&#8217;ll tell you that I went
up there to get out your winter things in order
to have them remodeled. By chance I looked
out of the window&mdash;it is a view rather worth
looking upon, you&#8217;ll admit&mdash;and, well I saw a
moving picture instead of the usual quiet landscape
and it was &#8216;going some&#8217; as Athol would
say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Mrs. Ashby smiled involuntarily as she recalled
the spirited action of that moving picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; cried Beverly eagerly.
&#8220;And, oh that little Apache is some horse,
mumsey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then her face resumed its defiant expression
and she continued: &#8220;But I showed them that
they couldn&#8217;t put it all over me and not pay
for it. They got the try-out of their lives and
<i>I</i> got two pounds of <i>decent</i> candy if I did get
some mud into the bargain. I&#8217;d have come
home to tell you anyway; you <i>know</i> I would
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I intimated a doubt of it, dear?&#8221;
The tone was very disarming, and warm-hearted,
quick tempered just-souled little Beverly
succumbed. Throwing her arms about her
mother&#8217;s neck she buried her head upon her
shoulder as she sobbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do forgive me. I was the horrid one
for doubting you and saying such nasty things.
Please give me bally hack and send me away to
school quick. Then maybe I&#8217;ll learn to think
twice before I sass once, as Mammy Riah says.
I reckon what I need is a good strict schoolmarm
to boss me &#8217;round.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the &#8216;bossing&#8217; element will be absent
from the school we shall choose. I doubt it
would work very well with you, Beverly.
Sparks and gunpowder are apt to lead to pretty
serious explosions and I dislike pyrotechnics
which are likely to spread disaster. Now go
change your clothes and make yourself presentable
for I hear Uncle Athol calling and I dare
say the momentous question is about to be
answered. But what am I going to do without
my little whirlwind to keep things stirring?&#8221;
ended Mrs. Ashby, tenderly drawing the penitent
into her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And oh, mumsey, mumsey where shall I
ever find any one who will be as patient with
the whirlwind? I suspect I&#8217;m going to be desperately
homesick more days than once. But
I&#8217;ll truly, truly try not to disgrace you and
Woodbine. Yes, we&#8217;re coming Uncle Athol,&#8221;
as the Admiral&#8217;s stentorian tones came booming
up the broad stairway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Beverly, come along quick and hear
these letters. Lord save us, I&#8217;d rather run a
blockade than choose a school for a couple of
youngsters. I&#8217;ll be gray, dead and buried before
it&#8217;s done! Come down I say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming Uncle,&#8221; called Mrs. Ashby,
laughing softly as she pictured the gray-haired
old Admiral striding up and down the wide
hall anathematizing all the schools in creation
and launching side shots at the boys because
they were laughing at him. His roar was far
worse than his attack as the lads well knew, as
sitting&mdash;no, sprawling&mdash;upon the big claw-foot
sofa they did not hesitate to let fly a projectile
or two in return, only to howl at the result, for
well both knew his weakness for his grandniece.
&#8220;She could wind him around her little
finger,&#8221; they said.
</p>
<p>A moment later Mrs. Ashby appeared at the
top of the landing to be greeted by:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and hear these letters. Where&#8217;s Beverly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be down as soon as she changes her
riding skirt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys snickered.
</p>
<p>Turning upon them the Admiral demanded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you young scamps chortling
about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bev,&#8221; answered his nephew. &#8220;Did you see
her when she came in?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now what was the matter with her? She&#8217;s
usually all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing. Just a trifle muddy. Mother
can describe her appearance better than we can
I reckon,&#8221; laughed Athol, Jr.
</p>
<p>The Admiral bent his keen eyes upon the
boys. He was a handsome old gentleman and
wonderfully well-preserved for his seventy-three
years.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll lay a wager you fellows started the
ball rolling and Beverly had to brace up and
stop it,&#8221; he nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t! Honest, Uncle Athol, we didn&#8217;t!
Did we Arch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Bev. Here she comes,&#8221; laughed Archie
pointing toward the stairs down which a demure,
spick and span, duck-clothed young lady
was making her way with all the propriety of a
young boarding-house-miss-in-the-making.
</p>
<p>Instantly Athol had sprung to his feet and
was mincing along behind the Admiral in such
perfect mimicry of his sister that Archie hooted.
Beverly scorned to notice the by-play and
asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me Uncle Athol?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, come along into my study for this
er-er&mdash;well perplexing question is going to be
settled right here and now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Realizing that the settling meant a separation
for a shorter or longer time, and for a greater
or less distance, however determined, the boys
sobered down and followed the others into the
study.
</p>
<p>There is no use going into details. The letters
were duly read and discussed and it was decided
that early the next morning Admiral Seldon and
Mrs. Ashby should visit two of the schools,
those nearest Sprucy Branch being selected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And please, Uncle Athol, choose Leslie
Manor. It&#8217;s so near Kilton Hall that the boys
can ride over to see me and I can go to see them,&#8221;
begged Beverly, clasping her hands about her
great-uncle&#8217;s arm and looking up into his face
in a manner to coax the birds off the bushes.
</p>
<p>He drew her into his circling arm and turning
her face up to his asked, as he kissed the soft
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how in kingdom come do you suppose
<i>I&#8217;m</i> going to get on without your coming to
see me often, you torment of my soul. And how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
do you expect the boys to cover those ten miles
between Leslie Manor and Kilton Hall, much
less you? And a pretty stir-up it would make
if you were to go to their school, wouldn&#8217;t it,
you huzzy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m Athol&#8217;s sister, and almost Archie&#8217;s
too. Why couldn&#8217;t I go? We&#8217;ll have our
horses, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord bless my soul, are you counting on
moving the whole of Woodbine up yonder?&#8221;
asked the Admiral in dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why no, Uncle Athol, but of course we must
take Snowdrift, Royal and Apache,&#8221; answered
Beverly as a matter of course. Whereupon
Archie and Athol, standing just behind the
Admiral, and Beverly fell upon each other&#8217;s
necks. Such an idea as taking their horses
with them had never for a moment entered the
boy&#8217;s heads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see; We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; temporized the
old gentleman, &#8220;No&#8221; seeming to have been
left out of the vocabulary he employed in
speaking to Beverly.
</p>
<p>An hour was spent in discussing the subject
pro and con and at its end Admiral Seldon
cried:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Quit running on dead reckoning and tell
Mammy Riah to pack our grips, for your mother
and I are off on the eight-thirty from Sprucy
Branch and that means stepping lively tomorrow
morning, Mary. And I want Uncle Abel to
understand that the carriage is to be at the
door at seven-thirty,&mdash;<i>not nine-thirty</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so the die was cast. At seven-thirty
the following morning the carriage accompanied
by the three most interested in what the verdict
would be upon its return, sped down the broad
driveway, the leaves which had fallen during
the night crinkling beneath the wheels, the
carriage horses cutting all sorts of antics in
sympathy with their saddle companions cavorting
beside them, for the young people were
acting as body guard.
</p>
<p>It was not at all likely that the older people
would return that night, for train service was
limited, so all preparations were made for an
overnight trip.
</p>
<p>Bidding them good-by at the railway station
Beverly, Athol and Archie rode back to Woodbine,
in no mood for one of their wild stampedes.
The real parting was too close at hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>That day and evening seemed the longest
to Beverly that she had ever known. Archie
was to spend the night at Woodbine, and Aunt
Caroline, Mammy Riah and Earl Queen, the
butler, did their best to make up for the absence
of the heads of the house, but it surely was a
sober little group which sat down at the brightly
polished mahogany dining table. Beverly in
her mother&#8217;s seat, Athol in his uncle&#8217;s and
Archie as guest. Aunt Caroline had sent up
her daintiest preserves and had prepared a
supper &#8220;fitten&#8217; for a queen,&#8221; she averred.
Her fried chicken would have put Delmonico&#8217;s
to shame and her hot waffles were &#8220;lak ter fly
up offen de dish I serve &#8217;em on,&#8221; was Queen&#8217;s
affirmation as he took them from her, but nothing
was eaten with its usual relish.
</p>
<p>At ten the next morning came a long distance
phone call from Admiral Seldon.
</p>
<p>Beverly reached the phone first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s all settled? Which one? Leslie
Manor? Good! And Ath&#8217;s going to Kilton Hall?
Oh, splendid! You&#8217;ll be down on the three
o&#8217;clock train? Meet you? Of course. Yes, I&#8217;ll
tell the boys. Mother sends love? Give her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
ours and tell her we are all right and have been
as good as gold. Good-by!&#8221; and the phone
was hung up with a snap as Beverly spun round
and catching the one nearest at hand who
happened to be Archie, turkey trotted him the
length of the big hall before she&#8217;d end their
curiosity.
</p>
<p>And thus came the selection of the two
schools. Athol with Archie at Kilton Hall,
and Beverly at Leslie Manor, ten miles away,
and near one of the most wonderful and beautiful
caprices of that capricious lady Dame Nature,
that human eye is ever likely to rest upon.
</p>
<p>They were to leave Woodbine and Uplands
on the last day of September, as the school term
began October first, the intervening days being
full of the excitement incident to their departure.
</p>
<p>The thirtieth of September came at once too
rapidly and too slowly, and dawned crisp and
clear; a good omen for the start.
</p>
<p>Good-bys were said to the servants, Mrs.
Ashby was embraced tempestuously by Beverly
and given a bear hug by Athol, Archie shook
hands and all three followed Admiral Seldon in
to the waiting carriage, to wave good-bys to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Mrs. Ashby who stood upon the south portico,
and to all the servants gathered in the south
colonnade.
</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Ashby re-entered the silent house,
went upstairs to Beverly&#8217;s deserted room,
dropped into a chair beside her bed and burying
her head in the tumbled pillow wept like
a girl.
</p>
<p>A moment later Mammy Riah entered the
room, caught sight of the weeper, grabbed up
an old muddy shoe of Beverly&#8217;s and raining
tears into it forthwith raised a genuine darkey
wail of woe which very nearly turned Mrs.
Ashby&#8217;s tears into hysterics.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LESLIE MANOR</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the opening day at Leslie Manor.
Late the evening before the last girl had come
straggling reluctantly back after a long summer
vacation. This morning all was hustle and
bustle. At the rear of the building the last
trunks were being bumped down from the express
wagon which had brought them from the
railway station, and under the direction of
Wesley Watts Mather, the dusky porter, janitor
and general handy man, were being conveyed
to the various rooms in which they and their
owners would bide for the ensuing eight
months, for Leslie Manor did not open its
doors to its pupils until October first and closed
them the first week in June. This was at the
option of Miss Woodhull, the principal, who
went abroad each June taking with her several
of her pupils for a European tour, to return with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
her enlightened, edified charges in September.
It was a pleasurable as well as a profitable
arrangement for the lady who was absolutely
free of encumbrance and could do as she chose.
</p>
<p>Leslie Manor had once been the home of a
widely known southern family whose fortunes
had sadly decreased during the war and completely
evaporated after it. For several years
the place was entirely deserted and neglected,
then Miss Woodhull, recently graduated from
a New England college, and fairly bristling with
degrees, for which she had exchanged the freshness,
sweetness and spontaneity of youth and
health, was ordered to spend at least a year in
the south in the doubtful hope of recovering
the youth and health.
</p>
<p>Just where to find these valuable assets was
the hardest question to answer. Her only
relatives were an elderly maiden aunt and an
irascible old uncle whose time was too filled
with providing the wherewithal to maintain a
very elaborate establishment for a very vain
wife and three frivolous daughters, to leave
any left over in which to think of the welfare
of his only sister&#8217;s child. Moreover, his wife
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and daughters could not endure her, and, truth
to tell, they had about as much affinity for one
another as have oil and water. They might
flow side by side forever but never mingle.
</p>
<p>The maiden aunt was her father&#8217;s sister, an
austere dignified old party who resided most
exclusively in her ancestral home on Beacon
Street, and lived in a rut worn <i>ages</i> deep by
tradition, conviction and self-will. Virginia
was, so-to-speak, heiress-presumptive. Not
that she was likely to be supplanted by the
birth of some one having greater claim to her
aunt&#8217;s fortune. Her possible rivals for the very
substantial income which her aunt enjoyed were
foundling asylums, a new religious cult just then
in its infancy in the hub of the universe, and
innumerable &#8220;movements&#8221; and &#8220;reforms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had sent Virginia through college, provided
her with a fair allowance, bidden her make
something of herself for the sake of her name and
then washed her hands of all responsibility.
In her own sight she had fulfilled all her duty.
When Virginia Woodhull left &mdash;&mdash; College
after attaining degrees galore, but in broken
health, and with twenty-eight years checked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
off upon her life&#8217;s calendar, she seemed to have
run plump up against a stone wall.
</p>
<p>Dozens of positions were almost forced upon
her. Mentally she was qualified to fill any of
them, physically <i>not one</i>. Nor could she remain
near the only relatives she possessed had
they even cared two straws to have her remain.
</p>
<p>While in this depressing state of mind and
body a girl whom she had coached in the
college graduated and was about to return to
her home in Virginia. She was several years
Virginia&#8217;s junior, pretty, warm-hearted and
charming, and possessed the power of looking a
little deeper below the surface than the average
human being possesses. She invited Miss Woodhull
to accompany her to Roanoke and fate
stepped in and did the rest. The month was
spent in a lovely old home, Virginia Woodhull
gained in health and strength, and recovered
something in the way of nerve control and mental
poise. When the month ended she decided
to &#8220;do&#8221; the state whose name she bore and
spent the rest of the year in going from one
point to another in it until she knew its entire
topography by heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>In the course of her journeyings she visited
the Luray Caverns as a matter of course, and
enroute came upon picturesque, deserted, decrepit
Leslie Manor, and fell as enthusiastically
in love with it as it was given to her repressed
nature to fall in love.
</p>
<p>Moreover, for a long time she had been obsessed
with a desire to bring into this happy,
easy-going, contented state something of the
energy, progress, intellectual activities (as she
gauged them) of New England. The general
uplift inspired by the seat of learning she had
just left after post-graduate courses unto the
nth degree: To thoroughly stir things up and
make these comfortable, contented, easy-going
Virginians sit up and take notice of their shortcomings.
She was given a work in life, though
quite unsought, and she meant to undertake
it exactly as she has undertaken her college
course and make a fine job of it.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, according to
the viewpoint taken, the aunt in Boston was
ceremoniously tucked away in the tomb of her
ancestors just as this resolution crystalized and
Virginia Woodhull found herself in possession
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
of a very comfortable income, though said income
had a string attached to it which was intended
to yank it back to the religious cult
before mentioned in the event of Virginia&#8217;s
<i>marriage</i> or death. Either way considered, it
was a rather dubious heritage. But it served
to purchase Leslie Manor and the school became
a fait accompli. This was in the early eighties
and from its opening day the school had flourished.
Perhaps this was due to New England
energy and culture, or possibly some credit
rested with Mrs. Bonnell, the matron, and real
head of the house; a sweet lovable, gracious
Southern gentlewoman whose own family and
fortunes had vanished when she was a tiny
child, but who had grown up with relatives in
whose home love ruled supreme and in which
the little Veronica Dulany had blossomed as a
flower. At forty years of age she still retained
a genuine love and understanding of her fellow-beings
in spite of many sorrows, and the death
when she was still a mere girl of husband and
little daughter before she had been called Mrs.
Percy Bonnell five years.
</p>
<p>At any rate, for ten years Mrs. Bonnell had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
ruled supreme at Leslie Manor, engaging its
servants as she saw fit, directing the household,
economizing as she felt wisest; feeding hungry
girls, cuddling the homesick ones, caring for
the ailing ones, and loved by every creature
human or animal upon the place. Miss Woodhull
had no time for domestic matters and all
the sentiment in her had been killed in her early
childhood.
</p>
<p>And curiously enough the academic force at
Leslie Manor was about equally divided into
Woodhull and Bonnell factions. Miss Stetson,
the teacher of mathematics was in keen sympathy
with Miss Woodhull, as was Miss Forsdyke
the Latin teacher, and Miss Baylis, the
teacher of history and literature, but Miss
Dalton the gymnasium and physical culture
teacher, and Miss Powell who had charge of
the little girls, sided with Mrs. Bonnell as did
Monsieur Santelle, and old Herr Professor
Stenzel. Even Miss Juliet Atwell, who came
twice each week for aesthetic dancing, and
several other stunts, openly worshiped at the
Bonnell&#8217;s shrine. Herr Stenzel&#8217;s admiration
had more than once proved an embarrassing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
proposition to the lady, for Herr Stenzel loved
the flesh pots of Leslie Manor and knew right
well who presided over them. But Mrs. Bonnell
was equal to a good many Herr Stenzels.
</p>
<p>But in one sense we have wandered a long
way from Beverly Ashby and opening day at
Leslie Manor, though all these people vitally
concern her.
</p>
<p>Leslie Manor stood in the centre of a wide,
rolling, thickly wooded estate encompassed by
a holly hedge noted for miles around for its
beauty and its prickly barrier to freedom. The
house had been restored and added to in order
to meet the demands of a school harboring
sixty or seventy girls, though it still retained
its old lines of beauty and its air of hominess.
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull&#8217;s first concern had been &#8220;to
make the place sanitary,&#8221; the last word spelled
with italics, and to this end modern improvements
and conveniences had supplanted the
old, easy-going expedients of domestic economy.
Everything in Leslie Manor became strictly
modern and up-to-date. The upper floors were
arranged in the most approved single bed-chambers
or suites for the teachers and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
seniors, the lower ones were accurately divided
into living, dining and reception rooms. In one
wing were the model recitation rooms and Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s office; in another the undergraduate&#8217;s
rooms. Nor had the grounds been overlooked.
They were very trim, very prim, very
perfectly kept and made one realize this at
every turn. It also made one wonder how the
old owner would feel could he return from his
nameless grave at Appomatox and be obliged
to pace along the faultless walks where formerly
he had romped with his children across the
velvety turf. But he and his were dead and
gone and the spirit of New England primness,
personified in Virginia Woodhull, spinster aged
fifty-seven, now dominated the place.
</p>
<p>It was lovely to look upon, and compelled
one&#8217;s admiration, though it left some indefinable
longing unsatisfied. It was so orderly
it almost made one ache.
</p>
<p>Perhaps something of this ache unconsciously
obsessed Beverly Ashby as she sat upon one of
the immaculate garden seats, placed at the side
of an immaculate gravel walk, and looked
through a vista of immaculately trimmed trees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
at the dozens of girls <i>boiling</i> out of the door of
the wing in which most of the undergraduate&#8217;s
rooms were situated, for all members of the
under classes were housed in the south wing,
the seniors rooming in the more luxurious
quarters of the main building. Not that the
seniors were the happier for their exaltation.
They had enjoyed some pretty merry hours in
that old south wing, but with the advent of
the senior year were forced to live up to the
dignity of the main building. The faculty
occupied the north end of it.
</p>
<p>Beverly had arrived the previous afternoon
and, owing to the fact that she had never been
at school before in all her fifteen years, nor
journeyed very far afield from dear old Woodbine,
she did not know a soul at Leslie Manor
so far as she now knew.
</p>
<p>The parting of the ways when Athol and
Archie bade her good-by at Front Royal and,
accompanied by Admiral Seldon, went on to
Kilton Hall gave Beverly an entirely new sensation.
She then fully realized that she was
growing up and that the old happy-go-lucky
days of boy and girl frolicking were slipping into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
the background. That from that very spot
where the roads branched she must begin her
journey toward young-ladyhood, as the boys
must begin theirs toward manhood, and the
thought hurt like a physical pain. She didn&#8217;t
want to grow up and leave those happy days
behind.
</p>
<p>She had been met at Front Royal by one of
the teachers who was returning to the school.
Beverly had tried to talk to her as she would
have talked with any one at home. But Miss
Baylis did not encourage familiarity upon the
part of the pupils, and promptly decided that
Beverly was one of those irresponsible, impulsive
Southern girls who always proved such trials to
her and Miss Woodhull before they could be
brought to understand strict conventions. Consequently,
she had met Beverly&#8217;s warm-hearted,
spontaneous manner with frigid politeness and
had relieved herself of the young girl&#8217;s society
the moment the school was reached.
</p>
<p>Luckily, Beverly had fallen into Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s
hands directly she reached Leslie Manor,
so some of the ice coating in which she had made
the five-mile drive from the railway station had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
been thawed by that lovable lady. But she
had passed a desperately lonely evening in her
room unpacking and getting settled, and had
gone to bed in a frame of mind rarely experienced
by Beverly Ashby.
</p>
<p>Her room-mate, like many other tardy ones,
would not arrive until the next day, and the
whole atmosphere of the place spelled desolation
for Beverly.
</p>
<p>Her first Waterloo had been encountered
early that morning when, feeling lonelier than
she ever had felt in all her life, she dressed early
and ran out to the stable to visit Apache. He
seemed as lonely and forlorn as his little mistress
and thinking to cheer him as well as herself,
she had led him forth by his halter and together
they had enjoyed one grand prance down
the driveway. Unluckily, Miss Baylis had seen
this harmless little performance, and not being
able to appreciate perfect human and equine
grace, had been promptly scandalized. It was
at once reported to Miss Woodhull and Beverly
was informed that &#8220;such hoydenish actions
should be relegated to the uncultured herd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly did not ask whether she must number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
herself among that herd but the fact had been
implied nevertheless, and she smarted under
what she felt to be an unmerited and unduly
severe rebuke, if not an open insult.
</p>
<p>She was still smarting as she sat hidden in
her nook, and sorely in need of an antidote for
the smart.
</p>
<p>Presently it came in the homeopathic form
of like curing like.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>NEW FRIENDS</h3>
</div>

<p>Naturally, no real work was done on opening
day. Miss Woodhull, stately and austere sat
in her office directing her staff with the air of
an empress. One of the old girls declared that
all she lacked was a crown and sceptre, and the
new ones who entered that office to be registered,
&#8220;tagged&#8221; the above mentioned girl called
it, came out of it feeling at least three inches
shorter than when they entered. During her
reign in Leslie Manor, Miss Woodhull had grown
much stouter and one seeing her upon this opening
day would scarcely have recognized in her
the slender, hollow-eyed worn-out woman who
had opened its doors to the budding girlhood of
the land nearly thirty years before. She was
now a well-rounded, stately woman who carried
herself with an air of owning the state of her
adoption, and looked comparatively younger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
in her fifty-eighth year than she had in her
twenty-eighth.
</p>
<p>As Beverly sat in her nook watching the little
girls of the primary grades run out to their
playground at the rear of the building, the old
girls of the upper classes pair off and stroll
away through the extensive grounds, and the
new ones drift thither and yonder like rudderless
craft, she saw two girls come from Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s office. One was a trifle shorter
than Beverly and plump as a woodcock. She
was not pretty but piquant, with a pair of hazel
eyes that crinkled at the corners, a saucy pug
nose, a mouth like a Cupid&#8217;s bow and a mop of
the curliest red-brown hair Beverly had ever seen.
Her companion was tall, slight, graceful, distinguished.
A little aristocrat from the top of
her raven black hair to the tips of her daintily
shod feet was Aileen Norman and though only
sixteen, she was the one girl in the school who
could hold Miss Woodhull within the limits of
absolute courtesy under <i>all</i> circumstances. Although
descended from New England&#8217;s finest
stock, Miss Woodhull also possessed her full
share of the New Englander&#8217;s nervous irritability
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
which all the good breeding and discipline
ever brought to bear can never wholly eradicate.
Her sarcasm and irony had caused more
than one girl&#8217;s cheeks to grow crimson and her
blood to boil under their stinging injustice, for
Miss Woodhull did not invariably get to the
root of things. She was a trifle superior to
minor details. But Aileen possessed an armor
to combat just such a temperament and her companion,
Sally Conant&#8217;s wits were sharp enough
to get out of most of the scrapes into which she
led her friend. So the pair were a very fair
foil to each other and a match for Miss Woodhull.
What their ability would prove augmented
by Beverly&#8217;s characteristics we will
learn later.
</p>
<p>As they came down the steps from Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
office, said office, by-the-by, being in the
wing in which the recitation rooms were situated
and quite separate from the main building,
Sally&#8217;s eyes were snapping, and her head wagging
ominously; Aileen&#8217;s cheeks were even a
deeper tint than they ordinarily were, and her
head was held a little higher. Evidently something
of a disturbing nature had taken place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
They did not see Beverly in her bosky nook and
she did not feel called upon to reveal herself to
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all very well to stick <i>three</i> of us together
when we were freshmen and sophomores,
but juniors deserve <i>some</i> consideration I think.
If Peggy Westfield had come back this year it
would have been all well and good, but to put a
perfect stranger in that room is a pure and simple
outrage. Why we haven&#8217;t even an idea what
she&#8217;s like, or whether she&#8217;ll be congenial, or
nice, or&mdash;or&mdash;anything. Why couldn&#8217;t she have
given us one of the girls we know?&#8221; stormed
Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she likes to prove that she is great
and we are small, I dare say,&#8221; answered Aileen.
&#8220;Of course the new girl may be perfectly lovely
and maybe we&#8217;ll get to like her a lot, but it&#8217;s
the <i>principle</i> of the thing which enrages me. It
seems to me we might have some voice in the
choice of a room-mate after being in the school
three years. There are a dozen in our class
from which we could choose the third girl if
we&#8217;ve got to have her, though I don&#8217;t see why
just you and I couldn&#8217;t have a suite to ourselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Mercy knows there are enough rooms in our
wing and next year we&#8217;ll have to be in the main
house anyway, and I just loathe the thought of
it too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! So do I! But let&#8217;s reconnoiter and try
to spot our bugbear. I wonder if it wouldn&#8217;t
be appropriate to call her by another name?
We&#8217;ve got to share our <i>rooms</i> with her even if
we haven&#8217;t got to share our bed. Why didn&#8217;t
the Empress tell us her name? the stubborn old
thing! Just &#8216;a girl from Sprucy Branch will
share your suite this year. She arrived last
evening and has already arranged her things
in A of Suite 10.&#8217; A of course! The very
nicest of the three bedrooms opening out of
that study and the only one which has sunshine
all day long. You or I should have had it. I
don&#8217;t call it fair. She&#8217;s probably trying to make
a good impression upon Miss Sprucy Branch.
The name sounds sort of Japanesy, doesn&#8217;t
it? Wonder if she looks like a Jap too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well if you are speaking of me I can tell you
right now that Miss Woodhull hasn&#8217;t succeeded
in making any <i>too</i> pleasing an impression upon
Miss Sprucy Branch and so far as keeping Room
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
A in suite 10, is concerned, either of you is
welcome to it, because it would take just
mighty little to make me beat it for the stables,
mount Apache, habit or no habit, and do those
thirty-five miles between this luck-forsaken place
and Woodbine in just about four hours, and that
is allowing something for the mountains too.
Apache&#8217;s equal to a good deal better time, but
I should hate to push him, when we were heading
toward <i>home</i>. That would pay up for any amount
of delay. Thus far I haven&#8217;t found Leslie Manor
as hospitable as our servant&#8217;s quarters at
Woodbine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly&#8217;s cheeks were as red as Aileen&#8217;s, and
her eyes snapping as menacingly as Sally&#8217;s by
the time she had come to the end of her very
deliberately uttered speech, though she had not
moved a hair&#8217;s breadth upon her bench, nor had
she changed her position. Her head was
propped upon her hand as her arm rested upon
the back of the seat, but she was looking straight
at the astonished girls as she spoke.
</p>
<p>Never had there been a more complete ambush
sprung upon a reconnoitering party, and
for a moment both girls were speechless. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
was Sally who saved the day by springing away
from Aileen and landing upon the seat beside
Beverly as she cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are <i>you</i> to be our room-mate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I&#8217;ve got to be
<i>somebody&#8217;s</i> I suppose and I&#8217;ve been assigned
A 10. And from your conversation, which I
couldn&#8217;t very well help overhearing, you two
seem to have been assigned B and C for study
10. But I&#8217;ve just given vent to my point of
view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was still a good bit of electricity in the
atmosphere, but it must be admitted that for
the past eighteen hours Beverly had been pretty
steadily brushed the wrong way, and it was an
entirely new experience for her. Add to this a
good dose of homesickness and a sense of utter
loss at her separation from Athol, and her
present frame of mind is not difficult to understand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Beverly <i>Ashby</i> of Woodbine?&#8221;
persisted Sally, while Aileen dropped down upon
the seat beside Sally to listen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the laconic if uncompromising
reply.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s the best news I&#8217;ve heard since
I left Richmond, and I&#8217;m just tickled nearly to
death!&#8221; exclaimed Sally, spinning about to hug
Aileen rapturously. This sudden change of
base was so astonishing that Beverly&#8217;s sense of
humor came to her rescue and she laughed.
</p>
<p>Sally again pivoted toward her crying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I know you perfectly well! I&#8217;ve known
you all my life! And you know me just as well
as I know you. Don&#8217;t you know you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so that it overwhelms me,&#8221; laughed
Beverly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you meet Miss Ashby?&#8221; asked
Aileen who felt it was about time she came in
for this wholesale discovery of &#8220;auld acquaintance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon. This is Aileen
Norman, the third girl for suite 10. She&#8217;s
from Charlottesville and ought to know your
family too. I reckon you know hers. Everybody
does. Just like they know yours. Why
your mother and mine went to Catonsville to
school together. Didn&#8217;t you know that? She
was Sarah Wirt then. Why I think it&#8217;s too
lovely for words! And we were just as mad as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
fury when we started out to hunt up the new
girl we had to room with this year and here you
aren&#8217;t a new girl at all but one we&#8217;ve always
known. Why I&#8217;m so tickled I&#8217;m foolish. Hug
me Aileen or it will all seem like a dream and
I&#8217;ll wake up and find we&#8217;ve got to roost with
someone like that stupid Electra Sanderson, or
Petty Gordon, who can&#8217;t do a thing but talk
about that midshipman at Annapolis to whom
she says she&#8217;s engaged, and she&#8217;s only just seventeen.
She makes me tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll forgive us for all we said as
we came down the walk. We certainly had no
personal feeling as you must understand, but
we were pretty well stirred up over the idea of
having to begin junior year with someone we
didn&#8217;t know after having had the same room-mate
for three years,&#8221; explained Aileen diplomatically,
striving to pour a drop or two of
oil upon perturbed waters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t very well feel any resentment
toward you or Miss Conant when I didn&#8217;t
know either of you from Eve, and I&#8217;m sorry if I
seemed to. The truth is I was lonely and homesick
and just ready to light into anybody. Is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Miss Woodhull always so high and mighty, and
Miss Baylis so like an iceberg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, did you fall into her clutches the
first jump? She&#8217;s the limit! Oh, Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
so deadly afraid she won&#8217;t uphold the
dignity of dear Bosting and her Massy Alma
Mater that she almost dies under the burden,
but thank goodness, we don&#8217;t see much of her,
and Miss Baylis is <i>such</i> a fool we laugh behind
her back. She&#8217;s trying to make herself solid
with the Empress because she thinks she will
succeed to her honors when the high and mighty
lady retires. But she&#8217;s harmless because all
her airs and graces are veneer. Give her one
good scratch some day and you&#8217;ll see how thin
the veneer really is. But come on up to No.
10, and let&#8217;s get settled. Neither Aileen nor
I had any heart to do a thing until we found out
who had been popped into A. Cricky, but I&#8217;m
glad it&#8217;s <i>you</i>,&#8221; and slipping her arm through
Beverly&#8217;s right one while Aileen took possession
of the left, all three hurried toward the house,
Sally announcing:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll introduce you to all the nice girls and
we&#8217;ll call ourselves the &#8220;Three Mousquetaires.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
There may not be any such word, but
that doesn&#8217;t matter in the least: It&#8217;s Frenchy
and I <i>love</i> French. And besides, we mean to
band together to fight for our rights and down
oppression,&#8221; asserted this young Jacobin, as
arm in arm all three made their way to the pretty
suite allotted to them on the second floor of the
wing, for Beverly had entered Leslie Manor as
a junior, her previous work under Norman Lee
having well fitted her to do so.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A RUNAWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>By the end of October, the golden month, and
always beautiful in Virginia, things had shaken
into routine. During that time suite Number
10 had become one of the most popular in the
school, as well as one of the most attractive, for,
to the intense satisfaction of the trio their belongings
were in as perfect harmony as themselves,
Beverly&#8217;s things being pink, Sally&#8217;s the
softest green and Aileen&#8217;s all white and gold.
Consequently all went merry as a marriage bell.
</p>
<p>But there had been hours of intense longing
upon Beverly&#8217;s part for the freedom of bygone
days and Athol. The brother and sister had been
entirely too united in every way to find perfect
compensation in the companionship of others,
however warm the friendships formed, and each
missed the other sorely. Of course letters had
been exchanged during the month, but letters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
are a poor substitute for the voice of those we
love best. Only Mrs. Ashby realized how intense
was the brother&#8217;s and sister&#8217;s longing to
see each other. Archie, also, fumed under the
enforced separation and vowed that &#8220;something
was going to break loose mighty sudden if his
people and Athol&#8217;s didn&#8217;t get busy and <i>do</i> something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Had Beverly been at liberty to ride Apache
as formerly the ten miles separating the two
schools would have meant merely a jolly cross
country run, but she was only permitted to
ride when the other girls rode, and under the
supervision of a groom who was held responsible
for his charges.
</p>
<p>Nor had the boys been allowed to visit Beverly,
the male sex being regarded by Miss Woodhull
as a sort of natural enemy whose sole aim in life
was to circumvent, deprive and rob hers of its
just rights. Miss Woodhull was essentially a
militant suffragette and her stanch admirers,
Miss Baylis and Miss Stetson were her enthusiastic
partisans. Miss Atwell, the teacher
of esthetic dancing and posing, who came thrice
weekly to instill grace into the graceless and emphasize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
it in those who were already graceful,
sat, so to speak, upon the fence, undecided which
way to jump. She inclined strongly to the
strictly feminine attitude of dependence upon the
stronger sex, but was wise to the advantage of
keeping in touch with those occupying the seats
of the mighty at Leslie Manor.
</p>
<p>At Kilton Hall rules were less stringent.
The boys could ride every afternoon if they chose
and often did so, ranging the country far and
wide. Many a time they had gone tearing
past Leslie Manor when the girls were stived
up within and been exasperated at being &#8220;so
near and yet so far,&#8221; as an old song puts it.
Hence Archie&#8217;s frame of mind, and his determination
to change the existing state of affairs before
long if possible. Letters sent home by the
boys and those Beverly wrote to her mother
were the seeds sown which the three hoped
would later start the &#8220;something doing.&#8221; Meanwhile
Beverly chafed under the restraint, and
such chafing generally leads to some sort of an
outbreak.
</p>
<p>It was Wednesday afternoon, October twenty-ninth,
and riding-lesson day. Every Wednesday
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
and Saturday Andrew Jackson Jefferson,
whose name was as queer a combination as
himself, for he seemed to be about half <i>horse</i>,
so wonderful was his understanding of those
animals, and so more than wonderful <i>theirs</i> of
him, took his &#8220;yo&#8217;ng sem&#8217;nary ladies a-gallopin&#8217;
th&#8217;oo de windin&#8217;s ob de kentry roads,&#8221; proud as
a Drum Major of his charges.
</p>
<p>And well he might be, for Andrew Jackson
Jefferson had not only entire charge of the horses
belonging to Leslie Manor, but he had bought
them, and he knew good horseflesh. So the
Leslie Manor horses as well as the half dozen
boarded there by the students, were always a
credit to the school. Their coats shone like
satin, their hoofs were spick and span, no shoes
ever clicked for want of the proverbial nail,
fetlocks were trimmed like a bridegroom&#8217;s hair,
and manes and forelocks brushed to the silkiness
of a bride&#8217;s. Harness and bits were
scrupulous. Jefferson knew his business.
</p>
<p>When Apache was sent to Leslie Manor he
was such a contrast to the other horses that
Jefferson at first looked askance at him, but
Apache was a wise little beast. As a preliminary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
move he gently nozzled Jefferson, then by
way of showing him that he was not to be taken
too seriously, he flew up into the air, executed a
wild fling and descended upon the exact spot
from which he had risen, which exhibition so
tickled Jefferson that he grinned broadly and
announced to his underlings:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s some hawse! Yo&#8217; hyar me! Befo&#8217;
he&#8217;s done been in dis hyre stable a week he gwine
ter be eatin&#8217; outer ma hand,&#8221; and Apache verified
the statement by becoming Jefferson&#8217;s
abject slave before four days had passed, and
Beverly basked in reflected glory, for was she
not Apache&#8217;s &#8220;Yo&#8217;ng Mist&#8217;ess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kyant tech dat chile nothin&#8217; &#8217;bout <i>ridin&#8217;</i>&#8221;,
was Jefferson&#8217;s fiat when he saw Beverly astride
her little mouse-colored and white mount.
&#8220;<i>She</i> paht ob dat hawse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There had already been several riding lessons
since school opened, and each time Jefferson&#8217;s
delight in his newest charges increased. Born
and brought up with the race, Beverly knew
how to handle the negroes, and Jefferson as
promptly became her slave as Apache had become
his.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>Now the prescribed route for these riding excursions
was within a five-mile radius of the
school. &#8220;No further,&#8221; said Miss Woodhull.
Those bounds seemed safe from encroachment
upon the part of the Kilton Hall students, even
had their Wednesday and Saturday mornings
and afternoons not been entirely given over to
athletics, thus precluding excursions upon horseback.
</p>
<p>As a rule Jefferson took out eight or ten girls,
but this particular Wednesday afternoon several
had obtained permission to go to town with
Mrs. Bonnell to do some shopping, have some
photographs taken, see the dentists and what
not, so the riders were reduced to Sally, Aileen,
Petty Gaylord, Hope MacLeod, a senior, and
Beverly. All were well mounted and each was
looking her best in her trim habit.
</p>
<p>It was customary for the party to stop at the
porte cochere to be inspected by Miss Woodhull,
but on this particular afternoon Miss Woodhull
was absent at a social function in the neighborhood
and the duty devolved upon Miss
Stetson, the teacher of mathematics, a strong-minded
lady with very pronounced views. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
dressed as nearly like a man as was compatible
with law and decency, wore her hair short, and
affected a masculine stride. She came from
Miss Woodhull&#8217;s state.
</p>
<p>Jefferson drew up his cavalcade of five and
awaited the appearance of Miss Stetson whom
he despised with all your true negro&#8217;s power to
despise &#8220;white folks what doesn&#8217;t know dey is
white.&#8221; Miss Stetson insisted upon calling
him Mr. Jefferson, affirming that &#8220;the race
never <i>could</i> be self-respecting or, indeed, wholly
emancipated, until treated as the equals of the
white race.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She now strode out upon the piazza, cast a
critical eye upon the horses, nodded and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very fit. Very fit. Quite in order. You
are to be commended Mr. Jefferson, but er&mdash;isn&#8217;t
there something a little peculiar in the
appearance of your horses&#8217; er&mdash;er&mdash;headgear?
Their <i>eyes</i> seem to be exposed more than usual;
and look somewhat bare, so to speak. Can it
be possible that you have forgotten something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fergot?&#8221; queried Jefferson, looking from
one animal to the other. &#8220;Ah cyant see nothin&#8217;
I&#8217;se done fergot, Miss Ste&#8217;son. What it look
lak ain&#8217;t on de hawses, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why their eyes seem so prominent. They
seem to <i>see</i> too much, er&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly was attacked with a sudden paroxysm
of coughing. Jefferson nearly disgraced himself,
but managed to stammer:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We doesn&#8217;t ingen&#8217;ally put blinders on de
saddle hawses, Miss, but ef yer says so I&#8217;ll tak
&#8217;em long back ter de stables an&#8217; change de saddle
headstalls fer de <i>kerridge</i> ones, tho&#8217; it sure
would look mighty cur&#8217;ous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No! Certainly not. It was merely a
remark in passing. You are the better judge
of the requirements I dare say,&#8221; and Miss
Stetson beat a hasty retreat, entirely forgetting
to warn her charges against venturing beyond
bounds.
</p>
<p>Could she have seen Beverly&#8217;s lips set she
might have grown suspicious. The riding party
started, Jefferson muttering:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma Lawd! dat &#8217;oman suah do make me
tired. Blinders on ma saddle hawses! Huh!
&#8216;<i>Mr</i>. Jefferson&#8217;. Reckon I bettah tek ter callin&#8217;
her Sis&#8217; Angeline,&#8221; Angeline being Miss Stetson&#8217;s
christian name.
</p>
<p>When the grounds of the school were left a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
few miles behind her Beverly drew up to Sally&#8217;s
side and said significantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not tell us to keep within bounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She forgot to. She was too busy missing
the blinders,&#8221; laughed Sally. Beverly laughed
softly and continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls hold in your horses when we&#8217;ve
gone a little further. I want to ride on ahead
with Jefferson. I&#8217;ve a word to say and I&#8217;ve
an idea he is in a receptive mood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you up to, Bev?&#8221; asked Aileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just watch out. We&#8217;ll take a new route today
unless I&#8217;m much mistaken,&#8221; and touching
Apache lightly with her heel she cavorted to
Jefferson&#8217;s side. He had been too absorbed in
his thoughts of Miss Stetson to leave room for
any others: Your darkie is not unlike a horse in
that respect; his brain is rarely capable of holding
<i>two</i> ideas at once. Perhaps that explains
why darkies and horses are usually in such
accord.
</p>
<p>As Apache careened against Jumbo&#8217;s side the
big horse gave a plunge forward which jerked
Jefferson&#8217;s wits back to his surroundings. That
was exactly what Beverly wished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217; Miss Bev&#8217;ly, you done scare Jumbo an&#8217;
me foolish,&#8221; he exclaimed, striving to bring
Jumbo down to his usual easy pace, for the
tall hack had resented the little broncho&#8217;s
familiarity, though he could not know that his
own grandsire and Apache&#8217;s were the same.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jefferson, will you do something to please
me this afternoon?&#8221; she asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shore will if it aint gwine ter get me into
no fuss wid de Misses,&#8221; temporized Jefferson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t get you into any fuss with anybody.
Miss Woodhull is not at home and Miss Stetson
was too busy trying to find out where the horses
had lost their blinders to tell us <i>not</i> to take the
road to Kilton Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jefferson almost chortled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, when we come to that road will you turn
down it and leave the rest to me? And don&#8217;t
be surprised or frightened at anything Apache
may do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I aint scared none at what you an&#8217; dat hawse
doin&#8217;. He&#8217;s got sense and&mdash;&#8221; added Jefferson
with concession&mdash;&#8220;so has you. I aint got no
time ter be a troublin&#8217; &#8217;bout you-all. It&#8217;s dese
yo&#8217;ng ladies I has ter bat my eyes at; an&#8217; dey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
shore do keep me busy sometimes. Now what
I tell you? Look at dat?&#8221; and as though in
sympathy with Beverly&#8217;s schemes, Chicadee,
the little mare Petty Gaylord was riding chose
that moment to shy at some leaves which fluttered
to the ground and, of course, Petty
shrieked, and then followed up the shriek with
the &#8220;tee-hee-hee,&#8221; which punctuated every
tenth word she spoke whether apropos or not.
</p>
<p>That was exactly the cue Beverly needed.
A slight pressure of her knee upon Apache&#8217;s
side was sufficient. He was off like a comet, and
to all intents and purposes entirely beyond his
rider&#8217;s control.
</p>
<p>Sally and Aileen laughed outright. Petty
stopped her giggle to scream: &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s being
run away with!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so much as it would seem,&#8221; was Hope
MacLeod&#8217;s quiet comment as she laid in place
a lock of Satin Gloss&#8217;s mane, and quieted him
after his sympathetic plunge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well ef she is, she <i>is</i>, but I&#8217;m bettin&#8217; she
knows whar she a-runnin&#8217; <i>at</i>,&#8221; said Andrew
Jackson Jefferson more quietly than the situation
seemed to warrant. &#8220;But just de same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; we might as well fool oursefs
some,&#8221; and he hastened his pace, the others
doing likewise. It would never do to let one
of his charges be run away with and not make
an effort to save her from a possible calamity.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CLIMAXES</h3>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the runaways were having the
very time of their lives. Not since that two-mile
race to Four Corners for the letter which proved
the wedge to divide her own and Athol&#8217;s ways,
had Beverly been able to &#8220;let out a notch,&#8221; as
she put it. Nor had the little broncho been permitted
to twinkle his legs as they were now
twinkling over that soft dirt road. Virginia
roads were made for equestrians, <i>not</i> automobiles.
Head thrust forward as far as his graceful slender
neck permitted, ears laid back for the first unwelcome
word to halt, eyes flashing with exhilaration,
and nostrils wide for the deep, full
inhalations and exhalations which sent the rich
blood coursing through each pulsing artery,
little Apache was enjoying his freedom as much
as his rider. In two seconds they were at the
top of a rise of ground, down at the further side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
and out of sight of the others. Then, to make
the exhibition realistic, Beverly drew out her
hat pin, gave it a toss to the side of the road, and
the wind completed the job by whisking her
soft felt hat off her head and landing it upon the
roadside bush.
</p>
<p>Oh, it was glorious! Five miles? What were
five miles to the little beastie which had many a
time pounded off twenty-five without turning
a hair? Or to Beverly who had often ridden
fifty in one day with Uncle Athol and her
brother? Just a breather. And when there
swept through the gateway of Kilton Hall a
most exalted, hatless, rosy-cheeked, dancing-eyed
lassie mounted upon a most hilarious steed,
the gate-keeper came within an ace of having
apoplexy, for she was a portly old body.
</p>
<p>But Beverly did not pause for explanations.
Her objective point was the athletic field at the
rear of the building and her appearance upon it
might have been regarded in the light of a
distinct sensation. It would never do to forsake
too promptly the role of being run away with.
There were coaches and referees upon tennis
court, cinder path and football field, and boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
galore, in every sort of athletic garb, performing
every sort of athletic stunt.
</p>
<p>When Beverly set out to do anything she rarely
omitted any detail to make it as near perfect
as possible. As she tore across the lawn
which led to the field her sharp eyes discovered
Athol upon one of the tennis courts and closer
at hand a lot of other boys sprinting, gracefully
or otherwise, around the cinder path, taking
hurdles placed about a hundred feet apart.
</p>
<p>Now, if there was one thing in this world
upon which Apache and his young mistress
agreed more entirely than another, it was the
pure delight of skimming over a fence. A
five-footer was a mere trifle. The three-foot
hurdles upon the cinder path a big joke. The
tennis nets? Pouf!
</p>
<p>If Beverly really was tugging upon Apache&#8217;s
bridle he was not permitting anything so trivial
as a girl&#8217;s strength to bother him, and her knees
told him quite a different story as he swept
upon the cinder path, took two hurdles like a
deer and was off over the tennis courts and over
a net before the astonished players could draw
a full breath.
</p>
<p>Then they woke up!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a runaway!&#8221; cried Mr. Cushman, who
had charge of the football coaching, to be echoed
by the tall quarter back in football togs, as both
broke away in pursuit, the whole field quickly
taking the alarm also. But that tennis court
held one individual whose wits worked as quickly
as the star performer&#8217;s, and there and then
shrilled across it a high-pitched, peculiar whistle
which they both knew mighty well, and the
four-legged one obeyed instanter by wheeling
so suddenly that he put a very realistic climax
upon the scene by nearly unseating the two-legged
one, as he tore pell mell for the whistler
and came to a sudden halt in front of him, to
the increased astonishment of the general audience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, Bev! What&#8217;s let loose?&#8221; cried
Athol, trying to respond to Apache&#8217;s nozzling,
whinnying demonstrations of delight and reach
his sister&#8217;s extended hands at the same time,
while Archie did his record-breaking sprint across
the gridiron, and the whole field came boiling
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> have. Don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;ve been run away
with? It&#8217;s lucky Apache turned in here,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
answered Beverly, with remarkable calmness
for one so lately escaped from disaster or sudden
death, as she brushed back her flying locks, for&mdash;well&mdash;reasons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away nothing! <i>You</i> run away with!
Piffle. Ah, cut it out Apache! I know you&#8217;re
ready to throw a fit at seeing me, but keep
bottled up for a minute, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; he ended as
Apache lay hold of his tennis shirt and tried to
jerk him into attention. But he gave the bony
little head a good-natured mauling nevertheless,
as Archie rushing up exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a winner, Bev!&#8221; Then the others
surrounded them, the two coaches really concerned
lest the young lady had suffered some
mishap, and Mr. Cushman brushing the boys
aside as he asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you faint? Can we be of any assistance?&#8221;
and Mr. Ford, the new instructor from
Yale and mighty good to look upon (so decided
Beverly in the space of one glance) pressed to
her side to ask: &#8220;Were you riding alone when
your mount bolted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before Beverly could draw breath to reply the
answer came from another quarter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Now there is no such accomplished actor,
(or liar) upon the face of the round world as
your genuine darkey. Indeed he can do both
so perfectly that he actually lives in the characters
he temporarily creates and believes his
own prevarications, and that, it must be admitted,
is <i>some achievement</i>.
</p>
<p>When Beverly departed so suddenly upon her
self-elected route, Jefferson naturally had but a
very hazy idea of her intentions. He knew
Kilton Hall lay over five miles straight ahead,
and he knew, also that Beverly&#8217;s brother was at
school there, but Jefferson did not possess an
analytical mind: It could not out-run Apache.
He knew, however, that he must put up a pretty
good bluff if he wished to save his kinky scalp
upon his return to Leslie Manor, so he set about
planning to &#8220;hand out dat fool &#8217;oman a corker.&#8221;
Moreover, Petty was inclined to take the situation
seriously. Petty was sweetly romantic,
but stupidly literal. At times a hopeless combination.
The riding party had cantered along
in the fleeing Beverly&#8217;s wake for a little more
than a mile when Petty spied the hat upon the
bush. Nothing further was needed to confirm
her misgivings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She <i>has</i> been run away with, girls! She has!
I think it&#8217;s perfectly awful not to ride faster.
She may be lying on the road d-e-a-d-!&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time Jefferson thought it might be
politic to manifest more concern, so throwing a
well-assimilated anxiety into voice and manner
he said hastily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you fo&#8217; yo&#8217;ng ladies jist come &#8217;long
careful an&#8217; orderly, so&#8217;s not ter bring no mo&#8217;
trebbulations, &#8217;pon us an&#8217; I&#8217;ll light out fer dat
run-way. Ma Lawd, I&#8217;se been clar distracted
fer de las&#8217; ten minutes fer ter know which-a-way
ter tu&#8217;n! I aint really believe Miss Bev&#8217;ly is
in no danger &#8217;twell Miss Petty done got me so
sympathizin&#8217;, but now I&#8217;se shore rattled an&#8217;
I&#8217;se gwin&#8217; ter find out fer sartin. Come on yo&#8217;
Jumbo! Wo&#8217;k yo&#8217; laigs fer fair,&#8221; and under
touch of the spur the big horse broke into a gait
which bade fair to speedily overhand the scapegraces,
<i>providing Jefferson let him do so</i>.
</p>
<p>A turn in the road simplified the problem.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217; yo&#8217; tak ter sweatin&#8217; yo&#8217;self so&#8217;s
I has ter spend a hull hour a-coolin&#8217; yo&#8217; down,&#8221;
admonished Jefferson when well out of sight.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll git there, an&#8217; when we does we&#8217;ll mak&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
one fair show down,&#8221; and thereupon Jefferson
restrained his steed to a long swinging run which
told off the miles without making him turn a
hair until Kilton Hall was in sight. <i>Then</i> the
dusky actor and his mount prepared to make
their spectacular entré. Pulling up at the
roadside Jefferson threw his cap upon the
ground, twisted his tie awry, and let fly the belt
of his riding blouse, then dismounting, he caught
up a few handfuls of dust and promptly transformed
big bay Jumbo into as disreputable
looking a horse as dust rubbed upon his muzzle,
his chest and his warm moist flanks could transform
him. It was this likely pair which came
pounding across the athletic field of Kilton Hall
at the moment of Mr. Ford&#8217;s question, the human
of the species, with eyes rolling until they were
nearly all whites, shouting as he drew near:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lawd-a-mighty, Miss Bev&#8217;ly, is yo&#8217;
hu&#8217;t? Is yo&#8217; daid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a good enough bit of acting to have won
the actor fame and fortune. As a matter of
fact, Beverly gave one glance at the fly-away
figure, then clasping both arms around Apache&#8217;s
neck, buried her face in his mane and to all intents
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
and purposes collapsed into a paroxysm
of tears, to the entire dismay of Mr. Cushman,
and the skeptical &#8220;sizing up&#8221; of the situation
by Mr. Ford, more lately from the campus. It
was Athol who promptly turned a few handsprings
behind their backs and Archie who rolled
over upon the grass chortling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed! Don&#8217;t be alarmed, my
good man. Your young lady is none the worse
for her involuntary run (just here a distinct
snort came from the ground behind Mr. Cushman)
though I dare say a little unstrung and
exhausted. But we stopped her mount (&#8220;yes
you did!&#8221; came sotto voce from Athol) and
now we will lead your mistress back to the house
where Mrs. Kilton will be delighted to minister
to her comfort. Are you too nervous to ride to
the rear entrance, Miss Ashby?&#8221; for during the
few words spoken Mr. Cushman had discovered
that this was Athol Ashby&#8217;s sister, had the resemblance
left any doubt of that fact.
</p>
<p>Beverly resumed an upright position, hastily
wiped away her tears, (one <i>can</i> laugh as
well as weep them) and answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no sir. Of course I was a little startled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
at first, but Apache is never vicious, and it was
only the need of exercise which made us&mdash;<i>him</i>&mdash;bolt,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The acrobat came to an upright position and
very nearly upset the whole show.
</p>
<p>Meantime Jefferson with many flutterings
and gesticulations, had dismounted and managed
to work his way to Archie&#8217;s side and whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yo&#8217; let on, will yo&#8217; suh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your sweet life. It&#8217;s the best ever.
But where&#8217;s the rest of the bunch? There must
<i>be</i> some. You always take out a full fledged
seminary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Praise Gawd der aint but fo&#8217; dis time, an&#8217;
dey&#8217;s yander on de pike some&mdash;&#8217;ers. But I&#8217;se
near scared blue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gray, you mean. Keep cool. I&#8217;ll fix it
all right. Oh, Mr. Cushman the groom had to
leave the other young ladies back yonder on
the road and he&#8217;s a good bit upset about it.
Hadn&#8217;t he better ride back to them? They&#8217;ll
be scared blue you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Certainly. By all means. Return
to them at once. This young lady will be
carefully looked after,&#8221; and Jefferson lost no
time in going.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better bring the whole outfit&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
mean you&#8217;d better bring the other young
ladies to the Hall,&#8221; called Mr. Ford, deciding
that if Beverly was a sample of the Leslie Manor
girls it would be just as well to see more of the
material. Had he caught the sudden flash in
Archie&#8217;s eyes perhaps he would have grown a
bit wiser.
</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later all five girls were seated
in Mrs. Kilton&#8217;s cozy living room, the boys, and
the instructors who had shifted into drawing-room
garments in record time, serving hot
chocolate and little iced cakes.
</p>
<p>As they were not expected home until five
anyway there was no cause for concern. There
would be no alarm at Leslie Manor. Meanwhile
Jefferson, who had looked after the horses,
was holding the floor in the servant&#8217;s quarters.
If a report of that afternoon&#8217;s experiences did
reach Leslie Manor he meant to have first scoop.
</p>
<p>After an hour spent very delightfully, for Mr.
Ford was attention itself to Beverly, to Archie&#8217;s
ill-concealed disgust, Hope MacLeod advised
a move toward home. As they were about to
start Beverly asked sweetly:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Mrs. Kilton, would you mind if
Athol showed me his room? You know we
have never before in all our lives been separated
and I get so homesick for him and his traps it
just seems as though I couldn&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why of course you may go up, my dear,&#8221;
smiled kindly Mrs. Kilton. She was too wholesome
to see the least impropriety in so simple
a request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hold on a second, Ath. Keep her a
minute until I rush up and stow a few of our
duds. We didn&#8217;t stop to slick things up when
we shifted,&#8221; and Archie bounded away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now, Bev. I reckon he&#8217;s had time
to make Number 70 presentable,&#8221; said Athol
three minutes later, and the brother and sister
went demurely from the room.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>WHILE GOBLINS DANCED</h3>
</div>

<p>Although in little sympathy with frivolous
forms of entertainment, Miss Woodhull did condescend
to a Hallowe&#8217;en Masquerade each year,
and two nights after Beverly&#8217;s John Gilpin performance
the girls were preparing for the dance
in the big gymnasium.
</p>
<p>A collection had been taken up among the
sixty girls constituting the academic grades
and a couple of musicians engaged for the
occasion. They came from an adjacent town
where they formed part of a colored orchestra
of more than local fame, which was in great
demand for miles around. Consequently, the
girls would have good music for their frolic
and as Mrs. Bonnell looked to the refreshments,
everything was satisfactory excepting Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s veto upon &#8220;the absurd practices of
Hallowe&#8217;en:&#8221; meaning the love tests of fate and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
fortune usually made that night. Those were
debarred, though many a one was indulged in
in secret of which that practical lady little
kenned.
</p>
<p>As a hostess and chaperone were deemed absolutely
indispensable upon any occasion, however
informal, Mrs. Bonnell was always eagerly
sought after by the girls to act in the former
capacity and Miss Dalton the gym instructor
in the latter. Miss Dalton seemed just like a
girl herself, and was, in fact, not many years her
pupils&#8217; senior. She was in her twenty-fourth
year, but looked about nineteen, a jolly, chummy,
lovable woman, though no instructor maintained
better discipline, or was more willingly
obeyed. She and Mrs. Bonnell worked in perfect
harmony when their duties brought them
together.
</p>
<p>Now it is only reasonable to surmise that
Beverly and the boys had made the very utmost
of the fifteen minutes spent in Athol&#8217;s room the
previous Wednesday, and some lightening-like
communications had been interchanged. On the
way back to Leslie Manor, Beverly, Sally and
Aileen had kept somewhat in the rear, Petty and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Hope (by the latter&#8217;s finesse) contriving to keep
Jefferson between them. This had not been
difficult because Jefferson simply <i>had</i> to have
someone to talk to.
</p>
<p>What the three in the rear discussed will be
seen later. Those leading were needlessly trying
to convince Jefferson of the folly of making
any reference whatsoever to the unexpected
route taken that afternoon.
</p>
<p>Had they only known it, he was as anxious
as they were to keep the affair from headquarters,
his chief misgivings resting in the possibility
of the report coming from Kilton Hall. As
a matter of fact, it never occurred to either Dr.
or Mrs. Kilton to report it. It was a mere
incident which had ended rather pleasantly
than otherwise, and, as a matter of fact, the relations
between the two schools were not over
cordial. Dr. and Mrs. Kilton had made very
gracious overtures to Miss Woodhull when she
first opened Leslie Manor, but desiring to keep
distantly at arm&#8217;s length all relations with a
school that harbored boys, her response had been
as frigid as her New England coast line in February.
This was rather fortunate in the present
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
case. Dr. and Mrs. Kilton not only requested
the instructors not to give needless publicity to
the affair, or anxiety to Miss Woodhull by permitting
any report of the runaway to become
circulated, but also warned the servants and forbade
the boys discussing it abroad. And the
boys were wise enough to put two and two together.
So a discreet silence was maintained,
and Miss Woodhull spared a nerve shock.
</p>
<p>At seven-thirty o&#8217;clock on Hallowe&#8217;en, suite
Number 10 buzzed like a bee-hive. The three
occupants were dressing, two or three girls were
assisting at the robing, and two or three more
who were already costumed were acting as
spectators.
</p>
<p>Beverly was going as Tweedle-dum, her costume
consisting of funny little ruffled trousers,
a Lord Fauntleroy shirt, jacket and collar, her
hair braided and tucked inside her waist and
her head covered by a huge Glengarry bonnet.
Tiny patent-leather pumps and little blue socks
completed the funny makeup. She was as
bonny a little lad as one could find, her name
being plainly printed upon her big collar. Who
would complete the pair by being Tweedle-dee
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
no one had been able to coax from her. Her
reply to all the girl&#8217;s importunities being:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait and see if we don&#8217;t match well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally was to be Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp, and a
plump, spooky sprite she made with dabs of
phosphorus upon her fluttering black cambric
costume, and funny peaked cap, which glowed
uncannily when the room was darkened. She
carried a little electric bulb lantern which unexpectedly
flashed its blinding rays into people&#8217;s
faces.
</p>
<p>Aileen chose to be the evening star and very
lovely she looked in her costume made of several
silver-spangled scarfs draped over one of her
dainty &#8220;nighties,&#8221; which, of course, fell straight
from her shoulders. Her hair was caught up
with every rhinestone pin or buckle she owned
or could borrow, and Mrs. Bonnell had supplied
from the properties kept for private theatricals
the glittering star she wore above her forehead.
</p>
<p>Aileen moved a goddess and she looked a
queen, for she was a very stately, lovely young
girl.
</p>
<p>At the stroke of eight all were ready and a
general rush was made for the gym, the girls
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
laughing, talking, jostling each other and in
most hilarious mood, but, when they reached
that gaily decorated room Tweedle-dum was not
among them.
</p>
<p>The gym presented a pretty picture that
night lighted by pumpkin Jack o&#8217; Lanterns in
which electric bulbs had been hidden, and by
grotesque paper lanterns representing bats,
owls and all sorts of flying nocturnal creatures.
The side walls had been covered with gorgeous
autumn foliage, palms and potted rubber plants
stood all about, and last, but by no means least,
there was a long table laden with goodies and
more pumpkin decorations. The room was a
fitting scene for goblin&#8217;s revels.
</p>
<p>A barn dance had just begun, when down
through the gym pranced Tweedle-dum <i>and</i>
Tweedle-dee, and so identical were the figures
that no mortal being could have told one from
the other had they chanced to become separated.
But this they seemed to have no intention
of doing. Together they went through
the figures of the pretty fancy dance, prancing,
twirling, advancing, retreating; arms clasped
or held above each other&#8217;s heads, feet twinkling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
in perfect time, heads nodding, eyes dancing
through the peepers of their little black half-masks,
lips smiling to reveal faultless teeth.
</p>
<p>In two minutes everybody was asking:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who <i>is</i> it? Who <i>are</i> they? How <i>can</i> they
look so exactly alike? We didn&#8217;t know there
were two girls in the school who matched so
well, and who could do everything so exactly
alike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But neither Tweedle-dum nor Tweedle-dee
enlightened the questioners. Indeed, neither
spoke one word, signs having to answer to all
queries.
</p>
<p>Presently the musicians struck up a hornpipe,
when away they went in the jolliest dance eyes
ever looked upon, and would have absorbed
all attention had not a new diversion been created
just then.
</p>
<p>During their prancing, Sally, in her Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp
costume, had been darting in and
out between the tall potted plants and bowers
constructed of Autumn leaves, her luminous
tatters fluttering and her dancing light blinding
every dancer into whose face she flashed it.
</p>
<p>Just as Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
in the height of their performance she darted
from her bosky nook and flitted down the room,
closely followed by a tall Jack o&#8217; Lantern with
his pumpkin light. No one in the room was so
tall. Who could it be? There was just one
person in the school who might look as tall if
so disguised and that was Miss Stetson, but even
the liveliest imagination could hardly fancy Miss
Stetson in that guise. Moreover, Miss Stetson
could never have pranced with such supple
grace as this dancing Jack was prancing after
the Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp. No, it could not be Miss
Stetson.
</p>
<p>Towering above the nimble little Will, Jack
cavorted, swung his lantern and by signs indicated
his desire to imitate Tweedle-dum&#8217;s and
Tweedle-dee&#8217;s performances, to which Will
promptly acceded and the quartette hornpipe
was on.
</p>
<p>Now it was Miss Woodhull&#8217;s custom to grace
all festive occasions by her presence just prior
to the stroke of nine-thirty when refreshments
were served. The revelers were to unmask before
partaking of the feast. After the feast
they were at liberty to dance until ten-thirty
but not a moment later.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>The fun was at its height, Tweedle-dum and
Tweedle-dee had danced with every other goblin,
the evening star included, though it must be
confessed that Tweedle-dee had been unanimously
pronounced the better leader by his
partners, and Jack &#8220;almost as good as a boy; she
was so strong and danced so divinely,&#8221; though
none had as yet guessed the identity of either.
Then Miss Woodhull, escorted by Miss Baylis,
entered the gym. Had it been possible to suddenly
reduce the temperature of the room and
thus congeal the dancers the effect produced
could hardly have been more chilling.
</p>
<p>From the merriest, most hilarious frolicing,
the gayest, cheeriest bantering and laughter, to
the utmost decorum was the transformation
effected in two minutes after Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
and Miss Baylis&#8217; entrance. With the exception
of Tweedle-dum, Tweedle-dee, Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp
and Jack o&#8217; Lantern, the girls ceased dancing
and stood in groups and even the musicians
played more softly.
</p>
<p>There was not the vestige of a smile on Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s face as she looked upon the four dancers.
She tolerated such frivolity; she was compelled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
to do so; her school would have been unpopular
had she not done so; other schools
approved of them.
</p>
<p>Raising her lorgnettes, she looked sharply at
the four dancing figures. Then turning to Mrs.
Bonnell, who had crossed from the table to receive
her, she asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that strikingly tall figure in the Jack
o&#8217; Lantern costume. I did not know we had so
tall a girl in the school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I do not know, Miss Woodhull.
She came in after the dancing began. She sustains
the character well, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to know <i>who</i> she is. Send someone
for her if you please,&#8221; answered the principal,
ignoring the question. She was a little doubtful
of that tall girl. In times gone by some of her
pupils had been guilty of indiscretions. If
this were a repetition it must be nipped in the
bud.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnell beckoned to one of the masqueraders,
a jolly little Tam o&#8217; Shanta, and bade
him bring Jack.
</p>
<p>He nodded and instantly darted off in pursuit
of him. As well have tried to capture the original
of the character!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>The mad chase lasted perhaps five minutes.
Miss Woodhull was powerless. How could she
accuse Jack of disrespect to her or disregard
of her commands when he could not possibly
have known them? He was only acting his
part to perfection any way. Besides Tam never
had caught the goblins: The shoe had been on
the other foot. But at that second Jack
tripped over a ring set in the floor of the gym and
went sprawling, his pumpkin lantern flying out
of his hand and breaking into a dozen fragments.
Tam was almost upon him, but before he could
lay hold Jack was up again, had made a spring,
caught one of the flying rings which dangled
high above his head, swung like a monkey from
that to the next, and so on down the line until
he was in range of the gallery, at which he hurled
himself bodily, landed upon the railing, balanced
a half-second and was safe upon the gallery
floor, to the boundless amazement of the onlookers
and absolute banishment of their suspicions
regarding the identity of Miss Stetson.
That spring settled his fate with Miss Woodhull:
No girl in Leslie Manor could have performed
such a feat, and all the dancers were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
staring speechless. It was the ominous silence
before the storm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That masquerader is not a girl, Miss Bonnell!
It is some boy! Who has perpetrated this outrage?
Miss Baylis, order all the outer doors
closed and guarded and a thorough search made.
This matter shall be sifted to the very bottom.
No, you will all remain in this room and immediately
unmask under Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s eyes.
I shall superintend the search,&#8221; and Miss Woodhull
sailed majestically from the room.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE SEARCH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it,&#8221; whispered Tweedle-dee to
Tweedle-dum, as the two comical figures drew
unobtrusively into the rear of the group of girls
now removing their masks under Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s
half-amused, half-serious eyes, for she began to
suspect that some sort of innocent prank had
been played which, like many another would
have harmlessly played itself out if let alone.
She had always been opposed to the rigorous
ban placed upon boys and their visits to Leslie
Manor by Miss Woodhull, believing and justifiably
too, that such arbitrary rules only led to a
livelier desire in the girls to meet said boys by
hook or by crook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; whispered Tweedle-dum &#8220;and come
behind this rubber plant. Now get down on your
hands and knees and follow me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tweedle-dee promptly obeyed orders and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
next moment was in front of the spiral stairway
which led to the gallery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourself as small as possible and crawl
on your <i>stomach</i> up this staircase. At the other
end of the gallery is a door leading into our wing.
I can&#8217;t tell you another thing. Just use your
wits,&#8221; and Tweedle-dum flitted back to be
swallowed up in the crowd of girls who, once
more restored to an equable frame of mind were
laughing merrily, everyone asking everyone else
if she knew who the Jack o&#8217; Lantern really was.
This very fact was sufficient reassurance for
Mrs. Bonnell. She knew girls better than Miss
Woodhull knew them in spite of having <i>known
nothing</i> else for more than forty years, but she
resolved then and there not to ask too many
questions, which fact made two girls her slaves
for life. The discipline department was not
her province nor was it one which anything could
have induced her to undertake. If Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp
was aware of the name of her partner in
the quartette hornpipe, or Tweedle-dum knew
Tweedle-dee&#8217;s surname Miss Woodhull was the
one to find it out, not she. So smiling upon the
group before her she asked:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you now all visible to the naked eye
and all accounted for? If so, let us to the feast,
for time is speeding.&#8221; No urging was needed
and lots were promptly drawn for the privilege
of cutting the fate cake. Mrs. Bonnell had not
considered it necessary to mention the fact that
she had ordered Aunt Sally, the cook, to bake
one for the occasion, and while good fellowship
and hilarity reign below let us follow two less
fortunate mortals whom the witches seemed to
have marked for their sport that night.
</p>
<p>Agreeable with Miss Woodhull&#8217;s orders, Miss
Baylis, who was only too delighted to shine so
advantageously in her superior&#8217;s eyes, had scuttled
away, issuing as she went, the order to close
<i>all</i> outer doors and guard them, allowing no one
to pass through. Guileless souls both hers
and Miss Woodhull&#8217;s, though another adjective
might possibly be more apt. The house had a
few windows as well as doors.
</p>
<p>Meeting Miss Stetson on the stairs she found
in her a militant coadjutor, and wireless could
not have flashed the orders more quickly. Servants
went a-running until one might have suspected
the presence of a criminal in Leslie Manor
rather than a mere boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, what of Jack o&#8217; Lantern and
Tweedle-dee? Jack, it must be admitted, had
the greater advantage in having made a quicker
get-away, but Leslie Manor had many bewildering
turns and corners, and when one has been
an inmate of a house less than&mdash;well, we won&#8217;t
specify the length of time&mdash;one cannot be
blamed for growing confused. Jack had made for
the very door Tweedle-dum had advised Tweedle-dee
to make for and darted through it muttering
as he paused a second to listen: &#8220;Gee, I
wish I wasn&#8217;t so confoundedly long legged!&#8221;
</p>
<p>No sound coming to his ears from any of the
rooms opening upon the corridor into which he
had darted, he sprinted down its length until it
terminated suddenly in a flight of stairs leading
to the lower hall. He had descended about
half way when a babel of voices sent him scuttling
back again, and a moment later a voice
commanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wesley, hurry up to the south wing. Whoever
is in the house certainly tried to make an
escape from that quarter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m. I catches &#8217;em ef dey &#8217;re up dar,&#8221;
blustered Wesley Watts Mather, hurrying up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the stairs and almost whistling to keep his courage
up, for your true darkie finds All Saint&#8217;s
Night an awesome one, and not to be regarded
lightly. Moreover, nearly all the electric lights
were turned off, only those necessary to light
the halls being left on, and this fact made the
rooms seem the darker.
</p>
<p>Now Jack o&#8217; Lantern&#8217;s costume, like Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp&#8217;s,
had been liberally daubed with
phosphorus and he still grasped the electric
flash-light which had illuminated his shattered
pumpkin. There was no time to stand upon
ceremony for Wesley was almost at the top of
the stairs. A door stood open at hand and he
darted through it into the room, overturning a
chair in the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, you! I done got you!&#8221; shouted his dusky
pursuer and burst into the room in hot chase.
The next instant the exaltant shout changed
to a howl of terror, for in the middle of that
room stood a towering motionless figure from
which radiated sheets of lightning, one blinding
flash darting straight into the terrified
darkie&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;A flash ob lightenin&#8217; what cl&#8217;ar
par&#8217;lyzed me an&#8217; helt ma feet fast to de floo&#8217;! Den,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
befo&#8217; I could get &#8217;em loosen&#8217; dat hant jist lif&#8217;
his hoof&mdash;yas ma&#8217;am, dat was a hoof, not no
man&#8217;s foot&mdash;an&#8217; I &#8217;clar cross ma heart he done
hist me froo dat do&#8217; an&#8217; cl&#8217;ar down dem stairs.
He want no <i>man</i>. He de debbil hissef. No
siree, yo&#8217; ain&#8217; gettin&#8217; me back up <i>dem</i> stairs
twell some white folks gwine <i>fust</i>. Not <i>me</i>.
I knows when ter lie low, I does.&#8221; (Goal kicking
develops a fellow&#8217;s muscles.)
</p>
<p>Nor could any amount of urging or scolding
prevail, and Miss Stetson, the strong-minded,
was obliged to go up to investigate. But
though every room was searched there was no
sign of mortal being. All the window sashes in
Leslie Manor had been rehung in the most approved
modern methods and could be raised and
lowered without a sound. A porch roof and a
slender column are quite as available as flying
rings to a born acrobat.
</p>
<p>As she was returning from her fruitless search
she encountered Miss Woodhull.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried that lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is <i>not</i> well. If there really was any one
in that wing, which I am compelled to doubt,
he has made a most amazing escape.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doubt?&#8221; repeated Miss Woodhull with no
little asperity. &#8220;You will hardly doubt the
evidence of my own eyesight, will you Miss
Stetson? I <i>saw</i> that person cross the gallery
and enter the south wing. Be good enough
to go down to the gymnasium and call the roll.
I desire to know if all the girls are accounted
for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To judge by Miss Stetson&#8217;s expression she
was none too well pleased by the principal&#8217;s
tone. Nevertheless, she repaired to the gym and
ignoring Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s assurance that no girls
were missing proceeded to call the roll. Of
course all responded.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miss Woodhull had summoned
Jefferson, who if no less superstitious, was
backed up by her august presence, and together
they mounted the stairs and made a room-to-room
inspection, peering into every closet or
any possible hiding place. Not a sign of human
being was found until they came to the study
of Suite 10, then a faint sound was audible in
bedroom A beyond.
</p>
<p>Quicker than it would seem possible for a person
of her proportions to move, Miss Woodhull
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
entered the study, reached the electric switch
and turned on the lights, calling at the same
moment:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is in that room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no reply, and the irate lady, speedily
covering the distance between the electric
switch and the bedroom door, turned on the
light in that room also.
</p>
<p>There stood Tweedle-dee.
</p>
<p>He had removed his mask and was about to
don a long gray automobile coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, Beverly, when I
gave explicit orders that no one should leave
the gymnasium?&#8221; demanded Miss Woodhull,
frowning portentously upon the delinquent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My costume is so thin I was cold. I came
up after my coat, Miss Woodhull,&#8221; was the
smiling answer, spoken quite softly enough to
turn away wrath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You came in direct disobedience to my
orders? You may now remain here for the rest
of the evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh please, Miss Woodhull, let me go back.
They are to have a reel,&#8221; begged her victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have spoken. You will remain in
your room.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>Without more ado the defrauded one hurled
herself into the middle of the bed, buried her
head in the immaculate pillows and burst into
a paroxysm of sobs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have brought this upon yourself. Had
you obeyed me there would have been no occasion
for this punishment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was freezing! I just won&#8217;t stay stived
up here while all the girls are having such fun
in the gym. It isn&#8217;t fair. I haven&#8217;t done a
single thing but get this coat,&#8221; was sobbed from
the bed, as a vigorous kick sent the eiderdown
cover flying almost in Miss Woodhull&#8217;s face. A
little more energy would have compassed it.
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull deigned no reply, but turning
swept from the room locking the door behind
her. She could deal summarily with rebellious
pupils. Then the search was resumed under
her eagle eye, but without results. Not a creature
was to be found, and dismissing her followers
she returned to the gym to get Miss
Stetson&#8217;s report.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are <i>all</i> the older pupils present?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; replied Miss Stetson somewhat
icily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Excepting Beverly Ashby, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beverly Ashby is here. She is standing
in the group near the table,&#8221; corrected Miss
Stetson with some satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible. I have just this moment locked
her in her room for disobedience and insolence.
You are mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly, as you may convince yourself by
merely looking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull did look and for a moment
felt as though caught in the spell of that mystic
night. Beverly Ashby stood laughing and talking
with Sally Conant, Aileen and Mrs. Bonnell,
as merry a little Tweedle-dum as one could
picture. Miss Woodhull caught her eye and
motioned her to approach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye gods and little fishes,&#8221; whispered Beverly
to Sally as she left the group and went
toward Miss Woodhull. That lady&#8217;s expression
was most forbidding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; she demanded icily.
</p>
<p>Beverly looked at her innocently as she
answered: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite understand
you, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not understand me? Is your intellect impaired?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
Did I not order you to remain in your
room for the remainder of this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull turned crimson. Such barefaced
audacity was unheard of.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you manage to leave the room, may
I inquire?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not left the room since I entered it
at eight o&#8217;clock, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bonnell,&#8221; called the now thoroughly
exasperated principal, &#8220;did you see Beverly
Ashby return to this gymnasium less than ten
minutes ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beverly has not been <i>out</i> of it, Miss Woodhull.
She has been enjoying her refreshments
with the other pupils.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridiculous! Miss Stetson, perhaps <i>you</i> have
a clearer idea of facts since I requested you to
return to the gymnasium and call the roll.
Was Beverly present when you did so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was standing not ten feet from me,
Miss Woodhull. Of this I am positive, because
her cap fell from her head as she replied
and delayed the response of the girl next on
the roll, who stopped to pick it up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are all irresponsible! These
silly Hallowe&#8217;en customs have turned your
heads. I have never approved such inane
proceedings. Why you may as well try to convince
me that I, myself, did not enter Suite 10,
and that I did not speak to Beverly Ashby in it
not ten minutes ago, and leave her there in the
middle of her bed weeping and conducting herself
like a spoiled child because she could not
participate in the closing Virginia Reel. Utter
nonsense! Utter nonsense! But we will have
no more hoodwinking, rest assured. There has
been quite enough already. You may all go to
your rooms reels or no reels. I have experienced
enough folly for one night&mdash;if not much worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a second there was profound silence, then
a general cry of protest arose. To be defrauded
of their Virginia Reel for no justifiable reason,
and sent to bed before ten o&#8217;clock like a lot of
naughty children when they really had not done
a single thing, was too much.
</p>
<p>Petty wept openly. Petty&#8217;s griefs, sorrow or
joys could invariably find prompt relief in tears
or giggles. She existed in a perpetual state
of emotion of some sort.
</p>
<p>Aileen murmured:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look at Miss Stetson&#8217;s face. She doesn&#8217;t
know whether to frown or smile. She will
lose her reason presently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why need the Empress have come in
at all. We were having such fun and&mdash;&#8221;
Sally paused significantly.
</p>
<p>Beverly nodded a quick comprehension of
what the conclusion of Sally&#8217;s sentence would
have been, and said, under cover of the babel
of voices, for even the Empress, stalking along
ahead of her rebellious ones could not entirely
subdue their protests:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am wondering what we shall find up
in Number 10, and especially in bedroom A.&#8221;
And in spite of those possibilities she laughed
softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And not a single mouthful of that delicious
spread after those ten miles. I call it a perfect
outrage,&#8221; muttered Sally like a distant
thunder-storm.
</p>
<p>Beverly flashed one quizzical, tantalizing
glance at her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let <i>that</i> worry you,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; whispered Sally eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush. Listen to the Empress. Oh, isn&#8217;t
this the richest you ever heard?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;DE HANTS DONE GOT DIS HYER HOUSE SURE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>They had now reached the south corridor,
Miss Woodhull in the full force of her convictions,
again heading straight for Suite 10, and
bedroom A, in order to substantiate her statement
of having within the past twenty minutes
locked Beverly in.
</p>
<p>She was affirming in no doubtful voice to Miss
Stetson: &#8220;There is no reason that I should try
to justify myself or endeavor to prove that my
faculties are unimpaired, unless I choose to do
so, but I prefer to convince both you and Mrs.
Bonnell that I generally know what I am talking
about. You will find that door securely locked!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They needed no urging, but the door opened
at a touch, locks nevertheless and notwithstanding.
The light was switched on instanter.
The room was absolutely undisturbed, likewise
the bed. The puff cover, so lately hurtling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
through space and straight for Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
august head, lay neatly folded in a triangle
across the foot of the bed. The pillow case
did not show a line or crease. The spread was
absolutely unrumpled. In short, not one single
thing was out of place or tumbled. The room
might not have been occupied for twenty-four
hours so far as any sign of disturbance was evident.
</p>
<p>Miss Stetson looked just a trifle skeptical.
Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s lips twitched a bit at the corners
though her face was most respectfully sober.
</p>
<p>With one withering glance at Beverly, the
teachers, and all concerned, Miss Woodhull
remarked scathingly: &#8220;If you were capable
of such expedition in worthier causes you would
lead the school,&#8221; and glancing neither to the
right nor left, swept from the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to retire at once and no noise, young
ladies,&#8221; ordered Miss Stetson, divided between
satisfaction at having proved her statement
regarding Beverly&#8217;s presence in the gym and
her resentment at being doubted at the outset.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnell had already retreated to her
special sanctum, there to have a quiet laugh over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the whole absurd situation. She had guessed,
of course, who Tweedle-dee and Jack o&#8217; Lantern
were and in spite of rules to the contrary, thought
it a rather good joke than otherwise. Presently
she would send the servants into the gym to
clear away the remains of the feast, but she
would have her laugh first.
</p>
<p>Miss Baylis, whose room was in the main
building with the seniors had repaired thither
to enforce compliance with Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
commands. No easy task, for some of the girls
were long past baby days and resented baby
treatment. The other teachers also had their
hands full. Consequently the south wing was
left entirely to Miss Stetson&#8217;s supervision, and
the south wing was a pretty sizable building and
naturally under existing circumstances, it did
not simmer down as promptly as under ordinary
conditions. Miss Stetson was compelled to
go from room to room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, be quick! Get undressed as fast as
you can and put out your light,&#8221; urged Beverly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; demanded Sally, who was
inclined to dawdle from very perversity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Springing another one on us, Bev?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Aileen, laughing softly but hastily complying
with orders.
</p>
<p>Beverly vouchsafed no answer beyond a
significant little jerk of her head.
</p>
<p>In five minutes the lights were out in A, B,
and C and Study 10 was in darkness also.
Miss Stetson, ever suspicious, tiptoed back to
peep in but found nothing amiss. Then a new
outbreak far down the corridor summoned her
to that end and Number 10 was for the time
being left in peace. This was the cue. Beverly
let about five minutes pass, then slipped out of
bed and into her bathrobe and bedroom slippers
in a jiffy. Sally and Aileen needed no hint
to follow suit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come quick,&#8221; whispered Beverly.
</p>
<p>Number 10 was fortunately, (or unfortunately)
nearer the door leading to the gym gallery than
some other suites. The corridor was now conveniently
dark, the lights having been extinguished
by Miss Stetson. Only the patches of
moonlight shining through the windows showed
the prowlers which way to turn. In two seconds
the gallery door was reached and the three were
upon the gym side of it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>Now Miss Woodhull&#8217;s pet economy was lights,
and woe betide the luckless inmate of Leslie
Manor who needlessly used electricity. The
girls often said that if the house ever caught fire
Miss Woodhull would pause in rushing from it to
switch off any electric bulb left burning. From
sheer force of habit she had switched off the
lights in the gym as she hurried from it, a key
happening to be at the side of the door through
which she led her brood. That the tail-end
of the crowd might have stumbled over something
was a trifling consideration.
</p>
<p>Beverly&#8217;s quick wits which had grasped many
details of Miss Woodhull&#8217;s idiosyncrasies, had
taken in this one. It served her turn now.
The gym was lighted only by moonlight, and
silent as silence itself. The girls tittered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the joke on you, Bev?&#8221; asked Aileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh look! Quick!&#8221; whispered Sally.
</p>
<p>Beverly merely nodded.
</p>
<p>At the further end of the room something
glowed uncannily. Then two figures stole into
a patch of moonlight, one tall and tattered;
the other enveloped in a long garment which
resembled a girl&#8217;s coat, and from out the darkness
came a sepulchral whisper:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where the dickens did you say that key
was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the last side-horse,&#8221; Beverly whispered
back. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I looked under the first one,&#8221; was the
disgusted answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get the box?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got it all O. K.,&#8221; replied the taller
figure, &#8220;and now we&#8217;re going to beat it. Good-night.
Did you get ragged again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing stirring, but we wanted to be sure
you got the eats. They&#8217;re great. Good-night,&#8221;
whispered Beverly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; and spook number one having
evidently found the key in question made for a
door which gave upon the rear terrace. Just
as he was about to insert the key the door was
opened from the outside and Wesley&#8217;s wooley
head was outlined in the moonlight. The
spooks darted behind the refreshment table and
the three watchers dropped into inconspicuous
heaps upon the gallery floor.
</p>
<p>Wesley had entered with his pass key in compliance
with Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s orders. The maids
who were to help him had lingered to get their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
trays. Wesley would have given a good deal
could the clearing up have been deferred until
the light of day, but he was obliged to obey
Mrs. Bonnell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar dose fool gals at wid dey trays?&#8221; he
muttered, &#8220;Seem lak gals ain&#8217; never whar yo&#8217;
want &#8217;em <i>when</i> yo&#8217; want &#8217;em, an&#8217; pintedly dar
when yo&#8217; don&#8217;. Ma Lawd, whar&#8217; dat &#8217;lectric
switch at,&#8221; he ended as he clawed about the
dark wall at the side of the door for the duplicate
of the switch Miss Woodhull had so carefully
turned off.
</p>
<p>As he found it a groan just behind him caused
him to swing sharply about.
</p>
<p>Unless one has heard a darkie&#8217;s howl of terror
at what he believes to be an apparition it is
utterly impossible to convey any idea of its
weirdness.
</p>
<p>Wesley tried to reach the door. So did the
tall spook. The result was a collision which
sent Wesley heels over head, and before he could
scramble to his feet again two spooks instead of
one had vanished.
</p>
<p>With a second howl the darkie shot across the
gym and out of the door which led into the main
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
building, where his cries speedily brought an
audience to which he protested that:
</p>
<p>&#8220;De hants done got dis house, suah!&#8221; and so
successfully drew attention to the main floor
that the three girls had no difficulty in slipping
back to Number 10 and raising a window to
listen to the thud of hoofbeats down the driveway.
</p>
<p>So ended All Saint&#8217;s Eve, though Wesley
Watts Mather long retained his horror of that
gymnasium after nightfall.
</p>
<p>Then for a time all moved serenely at Leslie
Manor. Thanksgiving recess was drawing nigh
and the girls were planning for their holiday,
which would begin on the afternoon of the day
before and last until the following Monday
morning.
</p>
<p>Beverly was, of course, going to Woodbine,
the boys to be her escort from Front Royal,
to which junction she would be duly escorted by
Miss Stetson, in company with Sally and Aileen,
who were also going home.
</p>
<p>Petty Gaylord was to join her doting mamma
in Washington and proceed from that city to
Annapolis to attend the Thanksgiving hop at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the Naval Academy with the idol of her affections
and also go up to the Army-Navy game
in Philadelphia upon the Saturday following,
and Petty was a very geyser of gurgling giggles
at the prospect.
</p>
<p>Beverly&#8217;s five days at home with the boys
seemed only to emphasize the separation of the
past two months and make the ensuing ones
harder to contemplate.
</p>
<p>The Sunday evening before she must go back
to school she was nestling upon the arm of the
Admiral&#8217;s big chair, her arm about his neck, her
dark head resting lovingly against his white one
as she &#8220;confessed her sins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From baby days this had been a Sunday night
custom, and more passed between these two in
those twilight hours than anyone else ever
kenned.
</p>
<p>The Admiral&#8217;s study was one of those rooms
which seem full to the very ceiling of wonderful
memories, and was also one of the homiest rooms
at Woodbine.
</p>
<p>It was the hour before tea time. Across the
big hall could be heard Earl Queen&#8217;s mellow
tenor as he softly intoned: &#8220;Swing low, sweet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
chariot,&#8221; while laying the table for the evening
meal, the little clink of silver and glass betraying
his occupation.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Ashby had gone upstairs with Athol to
unearth some treasures he wished to take back
to school with him. The big house was very
silent, a peaceful, restful spirit pervading it.
</p>
<p>Upon the hearth in the study the logs blazed
brightly, filling the big room with a rich, red
glow and the sweet odor of burning spruce.
</p>
<p>For some time neither Beverly nor her uncle
had spoken. He was thinking intently of the
confessions just made as he gazed at the darting
flames and absently stroked the hand she had
slipped into his, her other one gently patting
his shoulder. Now and again she kissed the
thick, silvery curls which crowned the dear old
head.
</p>
<p>Presently he said abruptly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now that you&#8217;ve gotten your load of
sins off your shoulders and bundled onto mine
do you feel better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say that I do, but I had to unload
all the same. There is no one at the school
to unload upon, you see. Besides, it could never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
be like you, any way. You always let things
sort of percolate, before you let off steam, but
it&#8217;s mostly all steam, or <i>hot air</i>, at Leslie Manor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon you can supply your share of the
latter, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; was the half serious, half-bantering
retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow, I haven&#8217;t felt exactly hot-airy since
I&#8217;ve been there. It makes me feel more steamy;
as though I&#8217;d blow up sometimes. It seems
so sort of&mdash;of&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t know just how to tell
you. I&#8217;d <i>like</i> to like Miss Woodhull but she&#8217;d
freeze a polar bear, and I believe she just hates
girls even though she keeps a girl&#8217;s school.
And Miss Stetson must have been fed on vinegar
when she was a baby, and Miss Baylis is
the <i>limit</i>, and Miss Forsdyke lives in Rome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anybody just right?&#8221; asked the Admiral,
quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them would be all right if they had
half a chance or dared. Mrs. Bonnel is a dear.
Miss Dalton&#8217;s lovely, but has no chance to prove
it. Miss Powell is the most loveable girl you
ever knew and the little kindergarteners adore
her. Miss Forsdyke would be lovely if she
wasn&#8217;t scared to death of Miss Woodhull and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Miss Atwell would be sort of nice if she wasn&#8217;t
so silly. Oh, Uncle Athol if you only <i>could</i>
see her pose and make us do stunts! And she&#8217;s
just like a jelly fish; all floppy and tumble-a-party.
I feel just exactly as though I hadn&#8217;t a
bone in my body after two hours flopping &#8217;round
under her instructions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in thunder do they waste time on such
nonsense for?&#8221; blurted out the Admiral.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To make us supple and graceful. Am I
stiff, Uncle Athol? I&#8217;ve always felt ten times
more supple after a rattling good gallop with
Ath and Archie, or half a dozen games of tennis,
than after I&#8217;ve turned and twisted myself into
bowline-knots with Miss Atwell. Oh, <i>how</i> I
miss the old good times, Uncle Athol! Why
can&#8217;t Ath come to see me or I go to see him
sometimes? If they&#8217;d only let me I&#8217;d never
think of running away as I did that day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord how can I tell the workings of an
old maid&#8217;s mind?&#8221; exploded Admiral Seldon.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too big a question for me to answer. I&#8217;ve
always had an idea that it was a good thing for
boys and girls to grow up together, and so has
your mother, I reckon, or she&#8217;d never have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
allowed you to romp &#8217;round with Athol and
Archie as long as you have. And I can&#8217;t for the
life of me see that you&#8217;re any the worse for it.
But maybe that&#8217;s just exactly the difference
between an old maid&#8217;s and an old bach&#8217;s viewpoint.
Can&#8217;t you wheedle her as you wheedle
<i>me</i>. Seems to me if you went at it like this
you might make her believe that the port and
starboard lights were black and white instead of
red and green. Try it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cuddle</i> Miss Woodhull! Uncle Athol would
<i>you</i> like to cuddle Miss Woodhull?&#8221; demanded
Beverly tragically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless my soul, No! I&#8217;d as soon cuddle
that statue of Diana yonder on the lawn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would <i>I</i>,&#8221; was the prompt reply. &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;d rather. She isn&#8217;t half so cold.
Wheedle? Hum. Wouldn&#8217;t it be funny if I
could? I&#8217;ll think about it. But if she were
as cuddable as you it would be&mdash;de-li-cious,&#8221;
she ended with a bear hug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Queen to announce tea. Come along
you artful huzzy. I never have an atom of
justice or logic in me when I talk to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he kissed her very tenderly as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
he untwined her circling arms. The past two
months had been very lonely ones for him without
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you try to make Miss Woodhull let us
see each other?&#8221; she begged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it. I&#8217;ll think about it.
And do you do some thinking too lest you disgrace
Woodbine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>going</i> to think. <i>Hard</i>,&#8221; she added, as
together they entered the cheerful dining room.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>AFTER THE HOLIDAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>The session between the Thanksgiving and
Christmas vacation always seemed a brief one,
filled as it is with plans for the latter holiday.
</p>
<p>When the Thanksgiving holiday was over
Beverly and the boys went back to their respective
schools under Admiral Seldon&#8217;s escort.
At least he went as far as Front Royal with
Athol and Archie, leaving them at that point
to go on by themselves while he accompanied
Beverly to Leslie Manor. He was minded to
have a few words with Miss Woodhull and know
something more of the lady&#8217;s character than he
already knew. The outcome of that interview
left a good deal to be desired upon the Admiral&#8217;s
part. He returned to Woodbine &#8220;with
every gun silenced,&#8221; and the lady triumphant
in her convictions that <i>her</i> methods of conducting
a school for girls were quite beyond criticism.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
It would be utterly impossible for Beverly to
even think of visiting her brother at Kilton
Hall, she said, nor could she consent to Athol
visiting Leslie Manor. She did not wish to
establish a precedent. As to Archie <i>ever</i> coming
there, <i>that</i> idea was preposterous. Why
every boy for miles around would feel at liberty
to call upon her pupils and they would be simply
besieged. She had conducted her school successfully
for many years under its present methods
and until she saw more cogent reasons for changing
she should continue to do so.
</p>
<p>Had not the Admiral made arrangements
for the year it is safe to surmise that Beverly
would have returned to Woodbine with him,
and his frame of mind, and the remarks to which
he gave utterance, as he drove back to the junction,
elicited more than one broad grin or
chuckle from Andrew J. Jefferson as he drove.
But Beverly did not know anything about it.
</p>
<p>So the weeks sped by until the Christmas recess
drew near and the girls were once more
planning to scatter, far and wide, for their two-weeks
holiday.
</p>
<p>Now be it known that Petty had returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
from her Thanksgiving trip to Annapolis in a
more sentimental frame of mind than ever, and
filled as full of romance as an egg is of meat.
</p>
<p>Each day brought a letter always addressed
in a feminine handwriting, to be sure, or there
would have been little chance of said letter ever
reaching Petty. They were, she confided to every
girl in the school under strictest promises of
secrecy, re-addressed for &#8220;Reggy&#8221; by &#8220;darling
mamma,&#8221; for mamma, knowing how desperate
was their devotion to each other, just simply
could not help acting as a go-between. And
she knew very well too that she, Petty, would
not have remained at school a single day unless
she did this. Why, mamma, herself, had eloped
with papa before she was sixteen. One whole
year younger than she, herself, was at that
moment. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that romantic?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is papa now?&#8221; asked Beverly. She
had never heard him mentioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why&mdash;well&mdash;he has business interests
which keep him in South America nearly all
the time, and&mdash;er,&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t go into details. It doesn&#8217;t
make any difference to me,&#8221; said Beverly, and
walked away with Sally.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she odious! And so perfectly callous
to sentiment,&#8221; cried Petty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a dear, and it&#8217;s a pity you hadn&#8217;t a
small portion of her common sense,&#8221; championed
Aileen emphatically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sense enough to be engaged before
I&#8217;m <i>seventeen</i>, and to know what it means to be
<i>embraced</i>, which is more than any other girl
in this school can boast,&#8221; brindled Petty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should hope it is!&#8221; was Aileen&#8217;s disgusted
retort. &#8220;And if you don&#8217;t watch out
you&#8217;ll boast just once too often and Miss Woodhull
will get wise to your boasting. Then there
will be something stirring unless I&#8217;m mighty
mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf! Who cares for Miss Woodhull? I
don&#8217;t believe she ever had a proposal in all her
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better be careful,&#8221; was Aileen&#8217;s
final warning as she left the half-dozen girls
of which Petty formed the bright particular
star.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those three feel themselves so superior yet
they are such children,&#8221; was Petty&#8217;s withering
remark.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Aileen was two months her junior. Sally
less than a year and Beverly exactly fifteen
months. But being engaged very naturally
developes and broadens one&#8217;s views of life.
Dear &#8220;Reggie&#8221; was just twenty, and had his
lady love but known that interesting fact, had
already been &#8220;engaged&#8221; to three other susceptible
damsels during his brief sojourn upon the
earth. Moreover, he was openly boasting of it
to his fellow midshipmen and regarding it as a
good joke. Oh, Reggie was a full-fledged, brass-buttoned
heart-breaker. Happily he was not a
representative among his companions. Most
of them are gentlemen. They can do a good
bit of &#8220;fussing&#8221; as they term it, but this wholesale
engagement business is the exception, rather
than the rule.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Petty had sang of the charms
of Annapolis until all her set were wild to go there,
and her enthusiasm had spread like chickenpox.
If the affairs at Annapolis were all Petty pictured
them and the midshipmen as fascinating,
the place must, indeed, be a sort of Paradise.
</p>
<p>Of course, all the girls knew that Beverly was
a real, true Admiral&#8217;s grandniece. That he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
had left Annapolis upon his graduation to take
sides with his native state. So why had Beverly
never been to that alluring place?
</p>
<p>Beverly had never given Annapolis a thought.
Now, however, she meant to know a few facts
regarding it, and while home on her vacation
learned a number. She also learned that sometime
in the spring, during the Easter holiday,
possibly, her uncle might take her and the boys
to Washington and while stopping in the capital,
visit the old town which lay adjacent to the
Naval Academy Reservation.
</p>
<p>Upon her return after the Christmas recess
Beverly made some casual allusion to this fact,
and at once started a new and livelier interest.
Why couldn&#8217;t a party of girls be chaperoned
there by one of the teachers, choosing the same
time?
</p>
<p>In five minutes it was all planned. But they
had Miss Woodhull to reckon with, and Easter
was still many weeks ahead on the calendar.
</p>
<p>When not long after came the mid-year examinations.
The girls had been working hard all
the week and were tired. Examinations had
ended the day before and they had about reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
the limit for that week. February was the
month most dreaded of all the eight. The last
period of each day was twelve to one, the juniors
had history and English literature under
Miss Baylis. Now Miss Baylis at her very best
was not a restful individual with whom to come
in touch, and after a long morning of hard work
and the growing hunger of healthy appetites for
food for the body rather than for the mind, the
girls did not find &#8220;a barbed tongue&#8221; and a
caustic disposition soothing.
</p>
<p>English literature as taught by Miss Baylis
was not inspiring to say the least, and the
half hour devoted to it had not aroused enthusiasm.
Then came the second half hour for
English history; Miss Woodhull believing it well
to take up the kindred subject while the girl&#8217;s
minds were well imbued with the first one.
Just as Miss Baylis was about to begin she was
summoned from the recitation room by Miss
Forsdyke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your books and refresh your memories
for a moment or two: I shall be back immediately,
and I <i>hope</i> you will employ this special
privilege in studying diligently. <i>You</i> in particular,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Electra, for you certainly did not make
a brilliant showing in your literature recitation.
Remember I shall expect you to redeem yourself
in history, for the periods are identical,&#8221;
was her admonition as she went toward the door.
As she was about to pass through it, she paused
to repeat her words. Sally yawned behind her
book. As the door closed Petty&#8217;s inevitable
&#8220;tee-hee-hee&#8221; was audible. The next second
the door was hastily opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>hope</i>,&#8221; and Miss Baylis&#8217; suspicious eyes
were upon her charges. Then she vanished.
Naturally someone else tittered.
</p>
<p>Barely five minutes passed and when she returned
her first words were:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope&mdash;&#8221; then she paused for a smile appeared
upon every face bringing the abstracted
lady back to earth. It was Beverly who asked
innocently: &#8220;Excuse me, Miss Baylis, but did
you tell us to begin our literature papers at the
ninety-fifth line of Pope&#8217;s Essay on Man: &#8216;Hope
springs eternal&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ended our literature recitation ten minutes
ago, Beverly. If you were so inattentive
as to miss what I said that is your misfortune,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
was the austere retort. Nevertheless, the shot
had told.
</p>
<p>Ten more minutes of the period slipped by,
nay, crawled by, in which Miss Baylis darting
from one victim to another bent upon reaching
their vulnerable points. Then it came, Electra
Sanderson&#8217;s turn to recite.
</p>
<p>Now Electra Sanderson was distinctly of the
nouveau riche. She came from an eastern city
where money is the god of things. Why her
father, a kindly soul who had risen from hod
carrier to contractor, happened to choose Leslie
Manor for his youngest daughter must remain
one of the unanswered questions. Perhaps
&#8220;mommer&#8221; made the selection on account of the
name which had appealed to her. Manors or
manners were all one to her. At any rate,
Electra (christened Ellen) was a pupil at Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s very select school. A big, good-natured,
warm-hearted, generous, dull <i>slouchy</i>
girl of seventeen, who never could and never
would &#8220;change her spots,&#8221; but was inevitably
destined to marry someone of her own class,
rear a flourishing family and settle down into
a commonplace, good-natured matron, Leslie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Manor nevertheless, and notwithstanding. Miss
Woodhull and her staff might polish until exhausted.
The only result would be the removal
of the plating and the exposure of the alloy
beneath.
</p>
<p>Electra didn&#8217;t care a whoop for the old fogies
who had lived and ruled in England generations
before she was born. Indeed, she would not
have wept had England and all the histories
ever written about her disappeared beneath the
sea which surrounded that country. What she
wanted now was to get out of that classroom
and into the dining room visible from the window
near which she was sitting, and through
which she gazed longingly, for there could be
found something tangible. Her thoughts had
been in the dining room for the past five minutes,
consequently she was not aware that Sally
had surreptitiously reached toward her from
the seat behind, laid hold of about eighteen
inches of the lacing of her Peter Thomson
(dangling as usual) and while Petty Gaylord,
sitting next Sally, was secretly reading a letter
concealed behind her book, had made fast
Electra&#8217;s Peter Thomson lacing to Petty&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
boot lacing, <i>likewise</i> adrift, and then soberly
awaited developments.
</p>
<p>Sally could manage to do more things unobserved
than any other girl in the school,
though she had found a fair rival in Beverly.
</p>
<p>Thus lay the train &#8220;of things as they ought
(not) to be&#8221; when Miss Baylis fired her first
shot at poor Electra.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Electra suppose you return to <i>this</i> world
of facts,&mdash;you seem to be in dreamland at
present&mdash;and tell me who brought a rather
unpleasant notoriety upon himself at this period.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Electra returned to England and English
affairs at a bound. But to which period was
Miss Baylis referring? Electra had not the
ghost of an idea but would make a stab at it
any way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why-er-oh, it was-er-the man who made
extensive use of bricks in the House of Commons,&#8221;
she ventured at random.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Miss Baylis, utterly
bewildered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. I mean yes, Miss Baylis.
I can&#8217;t remember his name but he did. I
learned that by heart last night at study period,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
staunchly asserted Electra, sure for once in her
life of her point, for hadn&#8217;t she <i>read</i> those very
words?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of &#8216;bricks&#8217;?&#8221; repeated Miss Baylis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes m&mdash;, Miss Baylis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Baylis&#8217; eyes snapped as much as any
pair of colorless blue eyes set too close together
can snap. One of the many hopeless tasks
which she had undertaken with Electra had
been to banish from her vocabulary that impossible
&#8220;ma&#8217;am&#8221;, yet like Banquo&#8217;s ghost it
refused to be laid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Open your book at that page and read the
sentence,&#8221; commanded the history teacher.
</p>
<p>Electra obediently did as bidden and read
glibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He made extensive use of&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221; and just
there came to an embarrassed halt as a titter
went around the schoolroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; Miss Baylis&#8217; tone of voice did not
encourage levity. &#8220;Well?&#8221; she interrogated
crisply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>bribes</i>, Miss Baylis,&#8221; said poor Electra,
covered with confusion and blushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. The greatest simpleton would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
understand that. Are you more familiar with
bricks than bribes?&#8221; It was a cruel thrust
under the circumstances, and Miss Baylis had
the grace to blush at the look of scorn which
darted from Beverly&#8217;s eyes straight into her
own and the curl which Aileen&#8217;s lips held.
But even a worm may turn, and for once Miss
Baylis was taken off her feet by having Electra
reply: &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s more honest to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; came from someone, but Miss
Baylis thought it wiser to ignore it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may stand and read that sentence five
times. Perhaps it may percolate after so doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Electra, still smarting under the sting of
Miss Baylis&#8217; sarcasm rose hastily, and with
her as hastily rose Petty&#8217;s foot to a horizontal
position, encountering in its ascent the rung
of Electra&#8217;s chair and toppling it over with a
crash.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>CULINARY EXPERIMENTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Most of the girls gave vent to startled exclamations,
but Miss Baylis was speechless with
rage. Electra turned and twisted in her frantic
endeavors to discover the origin of the upheaval,
and Petty made a mad scramble for her history
book which the sudden jerk had sent flying
out of her hands, the sentimental missive fluttering
from its hiding place to drop at Beverly&#8217;s
feet. Stooping hastily, Beverly caught it up
unnoticed in the greater confusion, though
she could not help seeing &#8220;Darling little sweetheart,&#8221;
in a large immature hand at the heading.
With a scarcely repressed laugh she hid
it in her book, and turned to face the storm
center, Miss Baylis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is responsible for this folly?&#8221; demanded
the irate one.
</p>
<p>There was no reply.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish an answer,&#8221; reiterated Miss Baylis,
turning to Beverly who sat near Petty. &#8220;Is
this your idea of a joke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, Miss Baylis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you guilty of this act?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Baylis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not tell if I did, Miss Baylis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall force you to tell,&#8221; was the unguarded
retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather hard to force an Ashby or a
Seldon to do something they consider dishonorable,
Miss Baylis,&#8221; was the quiet reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are insolent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not intend to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of this Miss Baylis was quite well aware.
She had begun to understand something of
Beverly&#8217;s character and to learn something of the
importance of this Woodbine family and their
standing in the community. Consequently she
turned her attention to Sally and asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your sense of honor equally nice? Which
of your classmates played this senseless trick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally remained silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear my question?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Miss Baylis.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then why do you not answer me. If you
are aware which girl did this silly thing why do
you keep silent when you know I am sure to
discover sooner or later?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps for the same reason Beverly has,&#8221;
answered Sally. &#8220;But why don&#8217;t you ask me
if <i>I</i> did it Miss Baylis? I&#8217;ve often done far
worse, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are rarely vulgar in your pranks,&#8221; was
Miss Baylis&#8217; amazing retort, which caused the
class to gasp. What was back of this extraordinary
hedging?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I <i>did</i> do it, Miss Baylis, and I am
perfectly willing to stand the punishment.
Shall I go to Miss Woodhull&#8217;s office after class?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wish to talk with you myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally looked scornful. Well she knew that
Miss Baylis had passed her vacation at Kittery
Point where Uncle Tom Conant, a bachelor had
also passed his. Uncle Tom was rich, good
looking and dapper. A lady&#8217;s man who charmed
every member of the fair sex with whom he was
thrown, but with no more idea of matrimony
than of murder in his heart. He was devoted
to his brother&#8217;s children, as well as the fair sex
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
in general and could no more help flattering
every one of them than he could help petting
the children who were always crowding about
him. Some of his stories of Miss Baylis&#8217;
&#8220;shining up&#8221; to him had nearly convulsed his
nieces. It was the memory of these which
brought the smile to Sally&#8217;s lips at the lady&#8217;s
last words. At that moment the last bell sounded
and Miss Baylis was obliged to dismiss her class
as quickly as possible. Miss Woodhull was very
intolerant of tardiness at meals. Upon the
instant the release bell sounded the classes must
be dismissed and each girl must hurry to her
room to make herself presentable at luncheon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally, you will come to me <i>immediately</i> after
luncheon. I am deeply pained that you could
be guilty of such deportment. I wish to talk
seriously with you,&#8221; was Miss Baylis&#8217; concluding
admonition to the incorrigible one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Baylis,&#8221; replied Sally, as she
scrambled up her books and joined the girls all
hurrying to their rooms.
</p>
<p>Petty lingered to glance beneath chairs and
desks for the lost letter. To her dismay it had
vanished completely. She never suspected that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Beverly running upstairs with the others, held
it safe in her history. She would return it to
Petty later. Just at present she was too much
amused by Miss Baylis&#8217; attitude toward Sally,
who had told her of some of the funny scenes
at Kittery Point, to think much about Petty&#8217;s
love affairs, and before luncheon was over a
diversion was created, which made her entirely
forget it.
</p>
<p>For some time, &#8220;Aunt Sally Jefferson,&#8221; the
cook at Leslie Manor had been ailing, and had
recently gone away to &#8220;res&#8217; up.&#8221; Mrs. Bonnell
knew well enough that it was useless to protest.
These &#8220;res&#8217;in&#8217; ups&#8221; were periodical. Usually
she substituted a colored woman who lived
at Luray, but Rebecca had taken a permanent
situation and was not available.
</p>
<p>Jefferson came to her rescue. He had a
&#8220;lady frien&#8217;&#8221; who could cook nearly as well as
his mother. Mrs. Bonnell was skeptical, but
it was a case of &#8220;needs must when the de&#8217;il
drives,&#8221; and Juno Daphne came as substitute
cook. Then Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s trials began. One
morning girl after girl left her fried smelts untasted
though ordinarily they were a rare delicacy
in that part of the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnell investigated. What <i>was</i> the
trouble? Had Juno prepared them properly?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m I did. I just done fry &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you clean and wash them carefully?&#8221;
persisted Mrs. Bonnell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m. Dey&#8217;s such triflin&#8217; fish I ain&#8217; see
no sense &#8217;n botherin&#8217; ter clean and wash &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next morning such smelts as had been left
uncooked for the previous breakfast, came to
the table a truly tempting sight, but with the
first mouthful a distinct murmur arose and
Mrs. Bonnell exclaimed: &#8220;Mercy upon me!
<i>What</i> has she done this time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inquiries followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas <i>ma&#8217;am</i>. I done wash &#8217;em <i>good</i> dis
time. I wash &#8217;em wid dat sof&#8217; soap what
Aunt Sally done made befo&#8217; she took sick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then for more than a week all went
serenely. Now dessert was being brought on.
Mrs. Bonnell always served it. Wesley came
in from the pantry bearing a large platter upon
which rested a mold of pudding of the most
amazing color mortal eye ever rested upon.
It was a vivid beautiful sky-blue and Wesley
disclosed every ivory in his ample mouth as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
set the dish upon the table. Mrs. Bonnell had
ordered corn-starch pudding with chocolate
sauce. When she looked upon the viand before
her she gave a little cry of dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wesley what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;De Lawd on&#8217;y know, Miss. I sho&#8217; don&#8217;.
Dat Juno done sent it in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go at once and ask her what she used in
making this pudding. I have never seen its
equal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ner I,&#8221; chuckled Wesley as he hurried off.
In five minutes he was back, his hand across his
mouth and struggling manfully not to disgrace
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Mrs. Bonnell, her lips twitching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she&mdash;&#8221; he strove to articulate. &#8220;She&mdash;she
say she done got de-de-sta-sta-sta&#8217;ch
in&mdash;de la&#8217;ndry, an&#8217; she&mdash;she&mdash;taken dat fer ter
be ec&#8217;nomical an&#8217; save &#8217;spence fer de school.
It&mdash;it&mdash;wor lef&#8217; over by Aunt Mandy f&#8217;om de
washin&#8217;. She ain&#8217; think,&mdash;ha&mdash;ha,&mdash;she ain&#8217;
think de <i>bluin&#8217;</i> in it mak&#8217; no diff&#8217;ence, he-he-he&mdash;.
Please, ma&#8217;am, scuse me, I can&#8217;t stan&#8217; fo&#8217; no mo,&#8221;
and Wesley beat a hasty retreat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>Juno Daphne departed that afternoon, Mrs.
Bonnell wishing to avoid the services of a coroner.
</p>
<p>As there was no study period on Friday
evenings the girls were at liberty to amuse themselves
as they chose. At least, within limitations,
though they often miscalculated the limitations.
The afternoon had been too dull and cold for
much outdoor exercise, so they had spent it in
the gymnasium practicing basket-ball. In
March they would play a game with a team
from a town a few miles from Leslie Manor.
</p>
<p>Beverly, Sally and Aileen were all on the
team, Beverly having made it through adaptability
rather than knowledge, for she had never
seen a basketball before coming to school, but
being as quick as a cat had made good. Consequently
the occupants of Suite 10 were glad
to rest their weary bodies upon couch or easy
chairs when dinner was over, and Sally was
entertaining them with an account of her interview
with Miss Baylis after luncheon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She makes me tired. If it had been you,
Bev, she would have sent you down to Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s office in jig time. But I&#8217;ve a good
one for Uncle Tom,&#8221; and Sally laughed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have cared if she had sent me.
I&#8217;d rather come to an issue with the Empress
anytime than with Miss Baylis. But the
whole thing was funny as the mischief,&#8221; answered
Beverly from her big wicker chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make some fudge. I&#8217;ve got the needfuls,
and it will sweeten our tempers. Such
things make me cross for hours. We don&#8217;t
indulge in petty squabbles at home. Mother
would be disgusted if she knew of some of the
things which take place here, and father would
say there was something wrong with the gasoline.
He&#8217;s just bought a new car so his metaphors
are apt to be gasoliney,&#8221; laughed Aileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you make the fudge in? You
let Hope MacLeod have the chafing dish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aileen looked daunted for a moment. Then
her face lighted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a tin pail. I can make it in that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>how</i>? You can&#8217;t boil it without the
lamp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I? Just you watch me do it.&#8221;
Aileen was resourceful. In a few minutes
she had the mixture in her pail, and the pail
swinging by a string over the gas jet. Leslie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Manor was quite up-to-date. It had gas as
well as electricity, though gas was not supposed
to be used excepting in cases of emergency.
Once or twice the electric current had failed.
</p>
<p>Aileen had fastened the string from one side
of the room to the other on a couple of picture
hooks. A none too secure support. Then all
three sat down to wait until the fudge gave
signs of boiling and promptly became absorbed
in a new interest, the Easter vacation.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the conversation, Beverly
paused. She had suddenly remembered Petty&#8217;s
note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten something,&#8221; she answered,
scrambling from her chair and crossing to her
desk for her history. She would take the note
back to Petty. It was utter nonsense of course,
but it was Petty&#8217;s and if she was pleased with
such nonsense, she was welcome to it. She
looked hurriedly through the book. The note
was not in it. Where could she have dropped
it? No, she had not dropped it, of that she was
certain. She had taken pains to keep the book
tightly closed. She meant to have given the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
note to Petty directly after luncheon. How
provoking! Maybe Petty had seen her catch
it up and had come for it herself. She would
go and ask her. As she turned to make her
intention known to the others there was a snap
overhead. The heat had burned Aileen&#8217;s string
before the fudge had begun to boil and pail
and contents descended upon the study table
with a rattle and splash, the hot mass scattering
in every direction.
</p>
<p>For the ensuing half hour the three girls had
their hands full and Petty, notes, history examination
and all minor affairs were forgotten.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>But Petty had <i>not</i> taken the note from Beverly&#8217;s
history. It had been removed by quite
a different person. In fact about the last one
either Beverly or Petty would have dreamed of.
</p>
<p>But of this a little later.
</p>
<p>By the time the fudge had been cleaned off
from everything within a radius of five feet, for
a more complete splash had never been made
by any descending mass, the &#8220;lights out&#8221; bells
were ringing in all the corridors. Miss Woodhull
had only to press a series of buttons arranged
in the hall just outside her study door
to produce the effect of the needle-prick in the
fairy tale. Every inmate immediately dropped
asleep. Every? Well, exceptions prove a rule,
it is said.
</p>
<p>The following morning Beverly told Petty
the circumstances of picking up the note and
of its subsequent disappearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Petty was in despair and scolded and wept
alternately, accusing Beverly of having deliberately
confiscated it, and hinting pretty broadly
that she had also read it.
</p>
<p>The moment this accusation left her lips she
regretted it because she knew it to be utterly
unfounded and the blaze which sprung into
Beverly&#8217;s eyes warned the little shallow pate
that she had ventured a bit too far. She tried
to retract by saying she was &#8220;nervous and
excited and <i>perfectly miserable</i> at the loss of the
letter. It was the first of Reggie&#8217;s letters she
had <i>ever</i> lost, and he had written every single
day for a <i>whole</i> year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three-hundred and sixty-five letters, and
every one mushy?&#8221; cried Beverly, incredulously.
&#8220;I should think it would be worse than eating
a pound of nougat every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Petty alternately moped and searched all
Saturday, but, of course to no purpose. When
Monday morning came she was in despair, and
went to her first recitation in a most emotional
frame of mind.
</p>
<p>It happened to be French, and Monsieur
Sautelle had been the French instructor but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
four months. Moreover, he had not yet been
in America a year and American girls, and things
American, were not only new but a constant
source of marvel to him. He lived in a world
of hitherto unknown sensations and this morning
was destined to experience an entirely new
one.
</p>
<p>The period was nearly over before it came
Petty&#8217;s turn to recite and Petty, as the result
of having spent all her study period in a vain
search for the lost letter, was totally unprepared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madamoiselle Gaylor, you will be so good
as to come the conjugation of the verb love,
indi<i>ca</i>tive mood, if you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Unfortunate choice!
</p>
<p>Petty was in a very indicative mood already.
Had he chosen any other verb she might have
survived the ordeal, but under the circumstances
to openly affirm: &#8220;I love; Thou lovest; <i>he</i>
loves&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, there are limits to every one&#8217;s endurance
under extreme emotion.
</p>
<p>Petty hesitated and was lost. Not a word
would come. Her throat throbbed and it
seemed as though that pound of nougat Beverly
had alluded to must be stuck in it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Proceed, if you please, Madamoiselle,&#8221; urged
Monsieur. Petty sat almost directly in front
of him, or rather she stood&mdash;Miss Woodhull
wished each pupil to stand while reciting&mdash;and
upon being urged to &#8220;proceed&#8221; raised to him a
pair of violet eyes swimming in tears, and a face
of abject woe.
</p>
<p>Monsieur Sautelle was not over thirty. A
dapper, exquisite little man. He was distraught
at the sight of this tearful damsel and, very
naturally attributed her distress to unpreparedness.
Petty was a pretty, inconsequential
little creature born to play upon the feelings
of one man or another. It did not much matter
who he happened to be so long as he could
satisfy the sentimental element in her makeup,
and she was mostly sentimentality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madamoiselle I implore. Why these tears?
You quite desolate me. It is no such crushing
matter that you do not know &#8216;to love&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But oh, I do. I <i>do</i>,&#8221; sobbed Petty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will most kindly demonstrate that
fact to the class. They wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If ever instructor was taken literally Monsieur
Sautelle was then and there, for with an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
overpowering sob she swayed forward, flung
both arms about the dismayed man&#8217;s neck and
burying her face against his immaculate collar,
gurgled: &#8220;Oh, I love! I <i>do</i> love! Thou lov-v-est!
He&mdash;He&mdash;loves&mdash;&mdash;<i>me</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the most astonishing conjugation the
startled Professor had ever heard in all his
thirty years, and he frantically strove to remove
the clinging damsel, at the same time commanding:
&#8220;Madamoiselle, Madamoiselle, make
yourself tranquil! You will cease at once.
Mees Woodhull! Mees Stetson, Mees&mdash;Mees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now it so happened that Miss Stetson&#8217;s
recitation room adjoined Monsieur Sautelle&#8217;s.
She heard his call and responded with wingéd
feet, arriving upon the scene just as Eleanor
Allen, Petty&#8217;s bosom friend, had sprung to her
side, and while in reality striving to untwine
Petty&#8217;s clinging arms seemed also to be in the
act of embracing the French teacher.
</p>
<p>What followed is almost too painful to dwell
upon, but within ten minutes, all three actors
in the little drama were arraigned before Miss
Woodhull and it was only Eleanor&#8217;s clever
tongue which saved the situation. She stated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
very emphatically that Petty had been too ill
to study on Saturday evening; she did not feel
it necessary to name the nature of the malady.
That it had been impossible for Petty to prepare
her lessons for Monday and that her act was
purely the outcome of nervous excitement and
held no personal demonstration toward Professor
Sautelle.
</p>
<p>This statement the Professor was more than
delighted to back up and Petty&#8217;s tears clenched
it. Miss Woodhull could not endure tears;
she had never shed one in her life so far as she
could recall&mdash;and she wished to end the scene
forthwith. Consequently the Professor was politely
dismissed and speedily went to procure
fresh linen. Under Miss Stetson&#8217;s charge Petty
was sent to the Infirmary, where she was
detained a week, and Eleanor was bidden to go
to her next recitation. But Eleanor, who was
Petty&#8217;s confidant in all things, instantly decided
to keep her trump card to be played when the
moment should be ripe. Eleanor had missed
her vocation in life. She should have been in
the Turkish diplomatic service instead of in an
American boarding school.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Eleanor had taken the note from Beverly&#8217;s
history. She did so because, having seen Beverly
pick it up and place it there she decided,
from innate suspicion of all her fellow beings,
that Beverly meant to use it to Petty&#8217;s undoing.
It never occurred to her that Beverly could
entertain a generous motive toward a girl whom
she held in aversion if not contempt. Then
the note once in her possession she wished to
keep it a day or so, in the hope that Petty
might discover for herself where it had gone.
It never entered her head that Beverly would
go straight to Petty and explain the situation,
and in a reticent freak quite uncommon to her
nature, Petty had not confided this fact to
Eleanor. And now it was out of the question
to do so for the pupils were not permitted to
visit the girls in the Infirmary.
</p>
<p>Two weeks later the basket-ball game with the
rival school was imminent and the team was
working like mad. Leslie Manor had been
beaten the year before and a second defeat
would spell disgrace. Eleanor was on the sub-team.
So was Electra. The captain and one
forward were seniors. Aileen center, Sally a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
forward, Beverly had made good as guard and
was working like a Trojan for the great event.
</p>
<p>The Friday afternoon before the game a party
of girls were taken to the village to do some
shopping. Nothing more diverting than purchasing
new shoe ties, hairpins, bows, and various
other trifles. Also to make sure that the decorations
ordered for the gymnasium would be
punctually sent over to the school that afternoon
and last, but by no means least, to indulge in
chocolate sodas etc., at the big drug store.
</p>
<p>It so happened that Miss Forsdyke, the Latin
teacher was acting as chaperone that afternoon
and Miss Forsdyke was alive just exactly two
thousand years after her time. She should have
lived about 55 B.C., for in reality she was living
in that period right in the Twentieth Century
A.D. and was so lost to all things modern, and
so buried in all things ancient, that she was
never quite fully alive to those happening all
around her. As a chaperone she was &#8220;just
dead easy&#8221; Sally said. A more absent-minded
creature it would have been hard to come upon.
</p>
<p>Sally, Aileen and Beverly were lingering over
the last delicious mouthfuls of nut sundaes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Electra had finished hers and gone to an adjoining
counter to make a purchase. Miss
Forsdyke, who had declined Sally&#8217;s invitation
to have a sundae, was selecting a tooth brush at
an adjoining counter when Beverly asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Forsdyke, why can&#8217;t we carry the flags
and ribbons back with us? Then we would be
sure of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Forsdyke laid down the tooth brush,
picked it up again, hesitated, then walked
toward Beverly, saying, &#8220;I am not quite sure
that Miss Woodhull would approve. She does
not like the pupils to carry parcels&mdash;large ones,
I mean&mdash;and these would be quite large, would
they not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not phone to her to ask if we
may?&#8221; suggested Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why-er-I-suppose I-I could. Will you
kindly direct me to the public tooth brush?&#8221; she
turned to the clerk to ask. &#8220;Oh no, no, I mean the
public telephone booth,&#8221; she corrected, coloring
a deep pink.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s behind you,&#8221; answered the clerk, trying
not to laugh, and pointing to the booth which
was exactly behind Miss Forsdyke. Still grasping
her tooth brush she scuttled into the booth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Naturally, Electra had been an interested
listener and Electra&#8217;s mind did not grasp two
ideas simultaneously as a rule. She had not
yet made her wants known to the clerk, who
stood deferentially waiting for her to do so.
As the possibility seemed vague he asked politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do for you, Miss?&#8221; and nearly
disappeared beneath the show case when Electra
answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please give me a glass eye. No, no,
I mean a glass eye <i>cup</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no school, it&#8217;s a blooming lunatic
asylum,&#8221; clerk No. 1 declared to clerk No. 2
as the last pair of shoeheels disappeared through
the door, &#8220;an&#8217; the <i>old</i> one&#8217;s the looniest of them
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some of those &#8220;lunatics&#8221; put
up a good game of basket-ball the next afternoon.
</p>
<p>As the game progressed the school and the
spectators were jubilant. At least one-half of
the latter were, and none more so than two
girls who had come with the rival team, as all
the Leslie Manor girls believed, and, although
strangers, certainly enthused more over the
blue and yellow, the Leslie Manor colors, than
over the green and red.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look at those two stunning girls in the
third row on the left side, Aileen. Do you know
who they are?&#8221; asked Sally, during one of the
intermissions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never laid eyes on them before,&#8221; replied
Aileen. Isn&#8217;t the tall fair one beautiful
though? I&#8217;ve never seen such eyes and skin
in all my life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows how to dress too, believe me,&#8221;
was Sally&#8217;s admiring comment. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
stunning velveteen suit she has on, and her hat
well, New York or Paris, sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The smaller one must be attractive too.
But isn&#8217;t it funny that she should wear her chiffon
veil under her lace one instead of outside of it?
I wish she&#8217;d raise them properly; I want to
get a good look at her face. Somehow she
reminds me of someone I&#8217;ve met before but
I can&#8217;t think of whom. We&#8217;ll ask Beverly.&#8221;
But just then the whistle blew and the game was
on again.
</p>
<p>When Leslie Manor won on a score of twenty
to seven, the girl in the chiffon veil jumped to
her feet, pitched her muff high into the air and
yelled. Then evidently overwhelmed with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
mortification at her wild demonstration instantly
dropped back upon her chair, aided in
her descent thereto by a vigorous tug from her
companion.
</p>
<p>At Beverly&#8217;s grasping, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; Aileen and
Sally started. Beverly had not noticed the
two girls until that instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. Just a funny kink in my side.
It&#8217;s all over now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played too hard. I knew you
would. Come quick and get a good rub-down.
You&#8217;re nearly all in. Why didn&#8217;t we realize
it sooner. Come on,&#8221; and full of solicitude
they hurried her away to the dressing-room,
her supposed indisposition driving all thoughts
of the strange girls from their heads, and when
the three were dressed and ready to join their
companions the visitors had disappeared; gone
undoubtedly with others who had come to
witness the game, and they never thought to
mention their presence to Beverly.
</p>
<p>That they in common with the other guests
had been ushered into Miss Woodhull&#8217;s library,
where, agreeable to custom, hot chocolate was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
served, had each, by some miraculous means
contrived to be served <i>three times</i>, and had held
a brief but most flattering conversation with
Miss Woodhull, Sally, Beverly and Aileen never
suspected. When they took their departure
Miss Woodhull suddenly remembered that they
had not been introduced to her and that she
had not the vaguest idea of their names. Which
of her teachers or pupils had been so very remiss?

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE TRUMP CARD</h3>
</div>

<p>It so happened that the presence of the two
strange girls had aroused the curiosity of someone
else, and that this somebody being of a
suspicious nature at all times required but little
to set her fancies a-galloping. She had watched
the girls all through the game, and at its end
sped away to the dressing room and changed
her clothes with remarkable expedition. Then,
instead of joining her companions in Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
reception room, where tea was to be
served to pupils and guests, she hurried into
her outdoor garments, and slipped out of a
side door, made her way around the house to a
clump of fir trees in which she could watch
undetected all who left the main entrance of
Leslie Manor.
</p>
<p>She did not have to wait long. The two girls
were among the first to leave, but instead of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
following the broad main walk as the other
guests did, they turned into a side path as
though wishing to stroll about the grounds.
The moment they were out of sight the suspicious
one was hot-foot upon their trail, and
Miss Eleanor Allen was compelled to do some
lively stepping out in order to overtake her
quarry. Only they were certainly most athletic
young women if one might judge from the
manner in which they strode forward.
</p>
<p>Naturally at that season of the year the outskirts
of the grounds were entirely deserted.
The elegantly dressed young ladies hurried
toward a dense clump of cedars which grew near
the prickly holly hedge, and, to Eleanor&#8217;s
amazement, the wearer of the big chiffon veil
began to tug and haul at it until it came loose,
while the taller girl began to divest herself of
her handsome fur collar and coat. Eleanor
gasped, and the next moment nearly passed
away, for now Miss &#8220;Chiffon-Veil&#8217;s&#8221; skirts fell
from her, and Miss &#8220;Tall-Blonde&#8221; began to
wriggle out of <i>her</i> garments as a boy might wriggle
out of his coat and vest.... It was all
Eleanor could do to repress a cry of horror.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Then off fell the big hat, the hair coming with it,
and before her stood a tall, fair boy in his trousers
and shirt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee Whiz! Ath, pitch me my coat quick!
Those girl&#8217;s togs nearly smothered me and now
I&#8217;m freezing,&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>The garments desired were picked out of a
bundle of things hidden in the cedars, and flung
at the shivering blonde, who promptly scrambled
into it, and drew from one of the pockets a cap,
which he jammed down upon his curly pate.
Then swooping down he caught up the feminine
gear lying upon the ground, jammed it pell
mell into a laundry bag, and heaved it over the
hedge into the road beyond, his companion,
now having cast his outer raiment, doing precisely
the same thing. Then both shinned up
a tall tree whose branches overhung the road,
walked like rope-walkers along a branch which
topped the hedge, and dropped lightly to the
ground. Eleanor ran to the hedge in time to
see the laundry bags pitched upon the backs of
two waiting horses, the boys scramble upon
their mounts and with a whoop of triumph
go pelting off down the road.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never! Well, I never!&#8221; gasped Miss
Paulina Pry, which was unquestionably the
absolute truth, though not characteristic. &#8220;That
was Beverly Ashby&#8217;s brother and her beau!&#8221;
Eleanor&#8217;s selection of common nouns was at
times decidedly common. &#8220;Now, Miss High-and-Mighty,
we will see what happens to girls
who are so very superior to other girls but can
read their letters and sneak boys into our school
against rules,&#8221; and back she sped to the house,
filled to the brim with knowledge, but with such
a paucity of wisdom in her brain that it was a
wonder she kept to the path. It was a pity
that no one was at hand to quote for her benefit:
&#8220;Knowledge is haughty that she knows
so much, but Wisdom is humble that she knows
no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the moment Eleanor Allen entered
Leslie Manor, she had been Petty Gaylord&#8217;s
slave, and a more complete &#8220;crush&#8221; never was
known. Flowers, candy, books, and what not
were lavished upon her adored one. Everything
that Petty would accept, and since Petty&#8217;s
discrimination was not of the nicest order all
proved fish which fell into her net. Eleanor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
lived in the atmosphere of Petty&#8217;s thrilling
romance until she almost felt it to be her own.
She had seen the lost letter flutter to the schoolroom
floor, and had also seen Beverly pick it
up. Her first impulse was to run and tell Petty,
but had no opportunity to do so in the classroom.
Then she decided to effect its rescue
herself, and while the others were at luncheon
had slipped into Beverly&#8217;s room and extracted
the note from her history. She never dreamed
that Beverly meant to return it to Petty and
did not know that she had gone to her the following
morning to explain its loss as well as she
was able. Eleanor intended to give Petty the
note at once, but when circumstances had prevented
her from doing so for several hours, she
made up her mind to keep it in her own possession
in order to use it to Beverly&#8217;s undoing.
Just how this was to be compassed she had no
very clear idea, and <i>now</i> had come a fine opening.
She hated Beverly because she had laughed at
Petty&#8217;s love affair, and ignored completely
the one who worshipped at Petty&#8217;s shrine.
The scene in Professor Sautelle&#8217;s room had
nearly thrown Beverly into hysterics, and Eleanor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
had also witnessed that. Oh, she had a
long score against Beverly Ashby.
</p>
<p>That evening as Miss Woodhull sat by her
study table reading a tap came upon her door
and Eleanor entered at the word &#8220;Come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull was not over-pleased at being
interrupted in the midst of a thrilling article
on the Suffrage question and the militant doings
of her wronged sisters in England. &#8220;Well?&#8221;
she queried crisply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to speak to you, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, speak,&#8221; was the terse reply.
</p>
<p>This was somewhat disconcerting. Eleanor
coughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be good enough to state your
errand without further peroration. I do not
relish being interrupted in my reading.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;thought I ought to tell you,&mdash;to
show you&mdash;I mean you ought to see this note
which I found,&#8221; and Eleanor crossed the room
to Miss Woodhull&#8217;s side, the note held toward
her.
</p>
<p>She took it, asking as she did so: &#8220;Why
come to me about so trivial a matter? What
is it? Where did you find it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it trivial and that is why
I came right to you,&#8221; Eleanor replied, ignoring
the embarrassing questions.
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull opened the note. The first
line acted like a galvanic shock. She sat up rigid
as a lamp post. The words were &#8220;Darling
Little Sweetheart:&mdash;&#8221; Then she read on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I close my eyes I can still feel your
soft arms about my neck and your kisses upon
my lips. I can&#8217;t wait much longer for you,
darling. Something must be done. I just can&#8217;t
stand it. I&#8217;ve got to see you before Easter.
It&#8217;s no use to say I can&#8217;t, because I&#8217;m going to&mdash;somehow.
So don&#8217;t be surprised at anything.
Leslie Manor is not so many miles away and
ways and means can be contrived in spite of all
the old maid guardians that ever lived. Wonder
if the old lady knows how it feels to have a man
kiss her? I bet she don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve never seen your
Suffragette queen, but I don&#8217;t need to after all
you&#8217;ve told me about her. She must be a
cuckoo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So keep your weather eye piped, sweetness
and leave the rest to your
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>Adoring &#8216;Boy&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>By the time the Empress reached the last
word of that missive her face had assumed the
color of a gobbler&#8217;s wattles, and her eyes were
blazing. Eleanor was nearly frightened to death
at the Genius of Wrath which she had invoked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom does this nauseating thing belong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not in an envelope when I found it,
Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor hesitated, it would never do to seem
too communicative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you understand my question?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then reply at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it in the south wing,&#8221; she said
hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The word was exhaled triumphantly.
&#8220;In the lower end of that wing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Near Suite 10?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She recalled the tall, acrobatic visitor of All
Saints&#8217; Eve. She had always suspected Beverly
and her suspicions had been confirmed when
Admiral Ashby asked her to sanction visits from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Athol and Archie. &#8220;You did quite right to
come to me with this letter. It is far too serious
a matter to be dealt with by my subordinates.
I highly commend your discretion. I shall sift
the matter to the bottom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor winced. That &#8220;sifting&#8221; might change
from a small affair to a large one, as a snowball
may grow into an avalanche. Then she said
with well-assumed contrition, &#8220;Oh, Miss Woodhull,
I would not for the world accuse <i>anyone</i>.
It may be just fun&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no element of fun in such a letter as
this, and absolutely no humor. I have realized
for some time that a decided atmosphere was
being created in this school, but have been unable
to discover its origin, and <i>this</i>,&#8221; giving the
letter the vicious shake a terrier would give a
rat, &#8220;may prove the touchstone. I need hardly
enjoin absolute secrecy upon your part. You
have already proved your discretion. If you
make any further discoveries you will, of course,
come to me at once. By-the-way, when did you
find the letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;several days ago, Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then why have you so long delayed coming
to me?&#8221; The eyes were very searching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;I might be mistaken.
That after all it really didn&#8217;t mean anything.
The girls often play jokes upon one another,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not such senseless jokes as this one I trust.
What caused you to alter your opinion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The professional stage certainly missed a star
when it failed to discover Eleanor. She hesitated,
looked down, then up with appealing
eyes. She twisted her fingers together and
untwisted them. She shifted from one foot
to the other, all of which was maddeningly
irritating to Miss Woodhull.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no time for hesitation,&mdash;speak!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon,&#8221; whispered Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit in that chair and tell me everything
without further circumlocution.&#8221; The tone was
final.
</p>
<p>With appropriate hesitancy the events of the
afternoon were graphically pictured for the
Empress. When they were completely drawn
she said with the grimness of Fate: &#8220;You may
go, but remember, not one word to your companions.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
A most superfluous admonition, for
Eleanor was nearly petrified with fear as it was.
She retreated to her room with all possible speed
and her room-mate wondered what had taken
place to make her look so pale, but refrained
from asking questions. Eleanor and her room-mate
were not entirely congenial.
</p>
<p>It was close to nine-thirty when she entered
her room which was on the floor above Beverly&#8217;s.
Down in hospitable Suite 10 the social
spirit was rampant. The Basket-ball victory
was being celebrated by a spread. Light bell
did not ring until ten Saturday nights. Beverly
was in the act of biting into a chocolate
eclair when Miss Stetson came to the door.
Beverly was sitting back to it and supposed it
was one of her companions.
</p>
<p>As all will concede, an eclair is, to say the
least, an uncertain quantity. Even upon a
plate and carefully manipulated with a fork,
it is given to erratic performances. When held
between a thumb and forefinger, and <i>bitten</i>
into, its possibilities are beyond conjecture.
Miss Stetson appeared at a most inopportune
moment (she usually did) and each girl rose to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
her feet, Beverly under the circumstances being
the last to do so because she had no idea that
Miss Stetson was anywhere near No. 10. Her
tardy uprising brought about the inevitable result.
Her teeth came together upon her eclair
and the filling escaped its bounds, landing in
many places that it should not have landed.
When Miss Stetson had removed about a tablespoonful
of cream filling from her bosom, she
said icily: &#8220;Miss Ashby, you are to report at
Miss Woodhull&#8217;s study at once,&#8221; and utterly
ignored Beverly&#8217;s apologies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Report at Miss Woodhull&#8217;s office at nine-thirty
at night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Consternation fell upon the revellers. The
hair had snapped and Damocles&#8217; sword had
certainly fallen.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A CRISIS</h3>
</div>

<p>Fully as bewildered as the girls she had left
behind her, Beverly went quickly to Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s study. So far as she could recollect
nothing could be scored against her deportment
unless, at this late date her wild gallop to
Kilton Hall had become known, or the presence
of Athol and Archie at the Hallowe&#8217;en frolic
had been discovered. True, she had recognized
Athol and his companion as they were leaving
the gymnasium that afternoon, but she did not
believe that any one else had. As to any foreknowledge
of that prank she had not had the
slightest. So her conscience was quite clear on
that score anyway. She tapped at the door
and was bidden enter. Miss Woodhull&#8217;s expression
as she looked at Beverly was most forbidding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Miss Woodhull. Miss Stetson
said you wished to see me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Utterly ignoring the greeting, Miss Woodhull
thrust toward Beverly the incriminating letter,
at the same time demanding: &#8220;Who has had the
audacity to send such a thing as this to you
while you are a pupil in my school?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly started at sight of the lost love billet,
Miss Woodhull noted the start and a sneer
curved her set lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one sent it to me, Miss Woodhull,&#8221;
she answered calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will probably add that you have never
seen it before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly did not reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have seen it before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you last see it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In my English history book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How came it there, pray?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I put it there myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you have the temerity to tell me
that it is not yours? Are you in the habit of
reading letters which are addressed to other
people?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the letter addressed, Miss Woodhull?
It was not even in an envelope when it came
into my possession.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have no doubt destroyed the envelope.
Nevertheless, I must insist upon knowing who
wrote that letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you, Miss Woodhull. I have
never looked at the signature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you resort to such fencing with
me? You cannot evade a direct answer, for
I have resolved to learn the writer&#8217;s name, and
report him to the principal of his school,&#8221;
asserted Miss Woodhull, jumping at conclusions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you the writer&#8217;s name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that you <i>will</i> not. But, I warn
you, this obstinacy only adds to the gravity
of the situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not obstinacy, Miss Woodhull; I do
not know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you admit having had this open letter
in your possession and insist that it is not your
own? A curious combination, to say the least,&#8221;
was the sarcastic retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the letter, but it is not mine. I
never read it, and I do not know the writer&#8217;s
name.&#8221; This was entirely true, Beverly had
never heard dear &#8220;Reggie&#8217;s&#8221; surname.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are likewise ignorant of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
identity of the two people who masqueraded as
Tweedle-dee and Jack o&#8217; Lantern?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were my brother and his friend Archie,&#8221;
was the prompt reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then you will admit something of this
intrigue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it can be called by so portentious a name,&#8221;
answered Beverly smiling.
</p>
<p>That smile acted like a match to gunpowder.
Miss Woodhull&#8217;s temper and self-control vanished
together, and for a few moments Beverly
was the object of a scathing volley of sarcastic
invective. As it waxed hotter and hotter Beverly
grew colder and colder, though her eyes
and cheeks were blazing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is useless to keep up this silly deception.
You may as well try to make me believe that
you were not aware of the presence of your
brother and your silly sweetheart disguised as
girls this afternoon, and that you did not lay
the whole disgraceful plan for them to escape
at the rear of the grounds.&#8221; Miss Woodhull
did not confide to Beverly that she had been
most beautifully hoodwinked by those same
girls, who had actually gone into the reception
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
room, partaken of the &#8220;eats&#8221; with the other
guests, held charmingly lisping conversations
with two or three of the faculty, Miss Woodhull
included, who had afterward commented upon
the &#8220;charming manners of the two young girls
who had come from Luray,&#8221; they having so
informed that lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweetheart?&#8221; repeated Beverly in amazement.
It was the one word which burned
itself into her brain. The tone in which she
echoed it ought to have enlightened Miss
Woodhull. &#8220;Archie my sweetheart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say that is what you call him, since
he so terms you in this missive,&#8221; sneered Miss
Woodhull.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Archie is like an older brother to me, Miss
Woodhull. We were raised together,&#8221; said
Beverly with a simple dignity which should
have prohibited further taunts of the kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Raised?&#8221; queried the lady. &#8220;Do you class
yourself with the vegetable or the lower animal
kingdom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you must have heard that expression
used before in Virginia,&#8221; was the quiet
reply, though her cheeks grew a deeper red, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
had Mrs. Ashby been present, and occupying
the tribunal it is safe to assume that she would
have been prepared for something to happen
right speedily. Indeed it was a wonder something
had not happened long ago.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just such barbarisms of speech that I
have spent a quarter of a century in a vain
endeavor to eliminate from the extraordinary
vocabulary of this section of the United States,
but I recognize it to be a Sisyphus task. That,
however, is aside the question. The vital ones
at this moment are: By whom was this letter
written? When did you receive it? What is the
meaning of its contents, and how you could have
had the audacity to hold clandestine meetings
with this young man? Also, how many times
he has actually forced himself into my school
disguised as a girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a slow even voice Beverly replied to each
question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know the name of the person who
wrote that letter. I never received it. I can
not tell you the meaning of the contents because
I do not know them. I have never held any
clandestine meetings with Athol or Archie, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
so far as I knew until after the game today they
had been in this school but once. At that time
I knew they were coming and we did it partly
for a lark and partly because I wanted so terribly
to see Athol.&#8221; A little catch came into her
voice just there. Miss Woodhull wholly misinterpreted
the reason for it and murmured
sarcastically:
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Athol.&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my twin brother, Miss Woodhull. I
do not expect <i>you</i> to understand what we have
always been to each other. As to their presence
here this afternoon, I knew absolutely nothing
of it until Athol pitched his muff into the air
and gave our old yell of victory at the end of the
game,&#8221; and Beverly nearly laughed at the
recollection of her start when the old familiar
sound fell upon her ears, and the memory of the
way in which that muff had hurtled into the
air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mirth is most ill-timed, Miss Ashby.
This is by no means a facetious occasion, please
understand. I do not lightly tolerate the infringement
of my rules, as you will learn to
your cost. If, as you state, you are ignorant of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
the contents of this letter you may now read it
aloud in my presence. Perhaps that may refresh
your memory and enable you to answer
<i>truthfully</i> the other questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull held the letter toward Beverly.
The girl did not stir.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you understand my command?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Miss Woodhull. I have already told
you the entire truth, but I must decline to read
that letter because it is not mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Decline! Decline!&#8221; almost shrieked the infuriated
principal. &#8220;Do you dare defy my commands?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wish to defy your orders, Miss
Woodhull, but I can not read someone else&#8217;s
letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly&#8217;s voice was trembling partly from
nervousness, partly from outraged pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall read that letter to me whether it
is yours or not though I have not the slightest
doubt that it is yours, and that you are trying
to shield yourself behind some purely fictitious
person. You seem to possess a lively imagination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Beverly stood rigid. Miss Woodhull waited.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will be good enough to give a
name to your fictitious being?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know to whom that letter was sent,
for I saw her drop it. I picked it up to return
it to her, but before I could do so it disappeared
from my history. I could not help reading the
first line because it stood out so plainly before
me when I picked the letter from the floor. I
know nothing further of its contents, and I do
not wish to. That line was silly enough. The
girl did not know what had become of it until
I went to her later and told her about finding
it and also about its loss afterward. From that
moment to this I have never laid eyes upon it,
and I wish I never had seen it at all. You may
believe me or not as you choose, but until I
came into this school such things had never
entered my head, and mother and Uncle Athol
would be perfectly disgusted with the whole
showdown. And so am I.&#8221; Beverly paused
for want of breath.
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Who dropped that letter?&#8221;</i> The words were
in italics, notwithstanding the fact that some
vague doubts were beginning to form in the back
of the principal&#8217;s brain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you for one second think that I will tell
you?&#8221; blazed Beverly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very positive that you will tell me
without a moment&#8217;s delay, or you will be suspended
from this school within twenty-four
hours, if not expelled. Her name! At once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never tell you no matter what you
do to me. What do you take me for? How
<i>dare</i> you think me capable of such a low-down,
mucker trick?&#8221; Unconsciously she had lapsed
into Athol&#8217;s vernacular. It was the last touch
to Miss Woodhull&#8217;s wrath. She actually flew
up out of her chair and catching Beverly by her
shoulders shook her soundly. Then it all happened
in a flash. Miss Woodhull was a tall
woman and a large woman as well. She weighed
at least one-hundred-seventy pounds. But from
lack of proper exercise (she loathed walking) and
the enjoyment of the many luxuries which the
past successful years had made possible, she
was exactly like a well-modeled India rubber
figure.
</p>
<p>Beverly was tall for a girl not yet sixteen, and
as the result of having grown up with two active
healthy boys, and having done every earthly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
thing which they had done, she was a living,
vital bunch of energy and well-developed muscles,
and fully as strong as Athol.
</p>
<p>Never since tiny childhood when Mammy
Riah had smacked her for some misdeed, or
her mother had spanked her for some real transgression,
had hand been laid upon her excepting
in a caress. That any human being could so
lose her self-control as to resort to such methods
of correction she would not have believed possible.
</p>
<p>Then in a flash all the fighting blood of the
Ashbys and Seldons boiled, and with a cry of
outraged feelings Beverly Ashby laid hold of
Miss Woodhull&#8217;s flabby arms with a pair of
slender muscular hands, backed her by main
force against the chair which she had so hastily
vacated, and plumped that dumbfounded lady
down upon it with a force which made her teeth
crack together, as she cried indignantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you touch me! How dare you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then with a whirl she was across the room,
out of the door and up the stairs to Study 10,
which she entered like a cyclone and rushed
across into her bedroom, slamming and locking
the door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>What mental processes took place behind that
locked door her astonished room-mates, who had
been eagerly awaiting her return, could not even
guess, and dared not venture to inquire. Not a
sound came from the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose has happened?&#8221; asked
Sally breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something a good deal more serious than we
have any idea of. Beverly Ashby is not the
kind of girl to look or act like that without a
mighty good cause. Did you notice her face?
It frightened me,&#8221; was Aileen&#8217;s awed reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked Sally in deep distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one single, solitary thing, and that&#8217;s
the very worst of it. We don&#8217;t even know what
has happened,&#8221; and the two girls began to prepare
for bed in a bewildered sort of way.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile down in that perfectly appointed
study a very dazed woman sat rigid and silent.
For the very first time in all her life she had
encountered a will stronger than her own, had
met in the person of an individual only a quarter
of her own age a force which had literally and
figuratively swept her off her feet and set at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
naught a resolution which she believed to be
indomitable. And worst of all, it had all come to
pass because she had lost her self-control. Up
to her own outbreak Miss Woodhull was forced
to admit that Beverly had been absolutely
courteous. It was purely her own act which
had precipitated that climax. For fully half
an hour she sat as one stunned, then she said,
and the words almost hissed from her colorless
lips:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall make an example of her! She shall
be expelled in disgrace!&#8221; though then and there
she resolved that none should ever learn of that
final scene, and&mdash;well&mdash;somehow, though she
could not explain her conviction, she knew that
the outside world would never learn of it through
Beverly.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>IN THE WEE SMA&#8217; HOURS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Beverly swept into her room her
thoughts were like a seething cauldron; One
instant one impression boiled to the surface,
only to be submerged the very next by others
surging to the top. She could not think connectedly.
Everything seemed jumbled pell mell
in her brains. Just one incident took definite
shape: She had been shaken like a naughty
child and told that she was lying. And all because
every instinct of honor and justice forbade
her betraying a class-mate, even though
she entertained for her little less than contempt.
And the effect of Miss Woodhull&#8217;s act was very
much as though a man had deliberately walked
up to Admiral Seldon, accused him of lying and
slapped his face.
</p>
<p>During the six months which she had spent
at Leslie Manor, Beverly Ashby had been no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
more nor less than just herself: neither better
nor worse than the average girl. But for her
six months in a boarding-school presided over
by a woman who had never known any real
girlhood, or girlhood&#8217;s exuberance, was an experience
far different than for the average girl.
Miss Woodhull had grown more and more iconoclastic,
and more of a law unto herself with
each advancing year. She had become as
adamant to all natural impulses, and apparently
dead to all affection. Bitterly intolerant of
suggestion, advice, or even the natural laws of
ethics. With each year she had grown more
difficult to live with, and less and less fitted to
govern growing girls. But in the beginning
the school had established a reputation for the
thoroughness of its curriculum and its instruction,
as well as for its discipline, and there is little
doubt that some of the girls which had come to
it during the past thirty years were in need of
some discipline.
</p>
<p>But Beverly Ashby was not of the type who
required discipline of the order Miss Woodhull
believed in. Beverly had lived for more than
fifteen years under the discipline of love and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
good judgement, and had developed fairly well
in that atmosphere. Her mother had never reproved
or punished her in anger. The Admiral,
while adoring her, was &#8220;boss of the ship,&#8221; and
both she and Athol had always recognized that
fact. His word was law. Moreover, she had
always been treated as a reasoning human being
<i>invariably</i> trusted; a nice code of honor having
been established from the moment the twins
could understand the meaning of that fine old
word. And that is much earlier in children&#8217;s
lives than a good many grownups believe.
</p>
<p>No wonder an outraged little mortal now sat
at her window, her heart beating tattoo, her
temples throbbing, her cheeks blazing, her eyes
flashing, but her hands clenched and icy cold.
There she sat until all sounds in the big house
were hushed. She was as rigid as though
carved from marble, even though her breath
came and went pantingly.
</p>
<p>The hand upon the clock in the stable tower
crept from hour to hour, the bell telling off the
half-hours. She neither saw nor heard. Then
came the twelve long deliberate strokes announcing
the witching hour. At the first stroke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Beverly started into life. By the time the last
had sounded the pretty pink dinner gown she
had been wearing lay in a tumbled heap upon
the bed where she had tossed it.
</p>
<p>By this time the moon which had been pouring
its flood of light into her room was dropping
behind the tall trees and the room was growing
dark. The steam heat had long since died
down and the room was cold. She was entirely
unconscious of physical conditions. Silently as
a shadow she worked, and with the swiftness of
a cloud scudding before a gale of wind. In ten
minutes the room was in perfect order and she
was garbed in her stout riding-boots, heavy
riding skirt, a warm flannel shirt waist and heavy
sweater. Her wool skating cap was pulled tight
down about her ears, and she carried her riding
crop in her gloved hands.
</p>
<p>Gently raising her window she slipped out
upon the piazza roof, crawled upon her hands
and knees to the edge, tossed her riding crop to
the ground and then, boy-fashion slid down the
piazza pillar as easily as Athol could have done
it. Picking up the riding crop she sped across
the lawn to the stable, well hidden by the foliage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Jefferson and his two assistants
slept in a little cottage behind the stable.
The stable door was locked but a small window
at the side had been left open for ventilation.
Monkey-wise she scrambled up and through it.
A low nickering from the horses greeted her;
they knew her at once. Apache was contentedly
munching his hay. Horses sleep or eat capriciously.
To slip on his bridle, adjust and cinch
his saddle took but a few minutes. Then she
led him from his stall, silently unbarred the big
doors, led him outside, again closed the doors
carefully, and mounted him. The night was
clear and cold. The moon, though now well
toward the western mountains, still made it
bright. Not a sound had Beverly uttered for
over two hours, but now, leaning forward she
clasped both arms around the little broncho&#8217;s
neck, rested her face against his mane, and
whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apache, no Seldon or Ashby can ever be
told that they are lying. Do you understand?
We are going back to people who don&#8217;t say such
things. It&#8217;s a long distance, and I don&#8217;t know
the way very well I may get lost, but I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
believe that <i>you</i> will. Take me safely home,
Apache. <i>Please, please</i> take me home to dear
old Woodbine and mother and Uncle Athol and
Mammy Riah and Athol and&mdash;and everybody
I love.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little sob ended the entreaty, and as though
he understood every word she had spoken
Apache gave a neigh loud enough to waken the
Seven Sleepers.
</p>
<p>Beverly clapped her hand across his nostrils
as she cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t! You will wake everybody
up! Go!&#8221; and with a bound Apache went,
but as though he now fully understood he swept
like a shadow across the lawn, out through a side
gate and down the pike. Jefferson on his cot
in the cottage roused enough to mutter:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat hawse a-hollerin&#8217;. I bettah get up an&#8217;
see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and then resumed his snore just where
Apache&#8217;s farewell had interrupted it. And out
in the great lonely, silent night the little horse
sped away like the wind. For a mile Beverly
let Apache gang his ain gait, then she drew him
down to the steady lope which he could keep
up for hours without tiring.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>The lines: &#8220;But there is a road from Winchester
town, A good broad highway leading
down,&#8221; might have been written of the first
five miles of the road Beverly was following, and
which led to Front Royal. Those miles were
covered in less than half an hour. But over
thirty still lay ahead and some of them would
have been pretty rough riding even in summer
time and with the roads in good condition.
</p>
<p>The moon was now dropping behind the distant
range of the great North Mountains, the air
was chill and penetrating, and the dense darkness
which precedes the dawn enveloped all the
world. Front Royal, save for a few scattered,
flickering lights, lay in absolute darkness. Beverly
drew a quick breath and shut her teeth
hard. From Front Royal to Luray her way
must be on dead reckoning and Apache&#8217;s incomprehensible
instinct, and those miles seemed
to Beverly to be double the length of ordinary
miles. Still, she knew, that she could not go
far astray if she kept between the railroad and
the river, so plucking up her courage she fled
through the sleeping town like a wraith. Once
beyond it the roads branched and her first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
doubt had to be settled. Dismounting, she
went close to the stone mile post and tried to
read the sign. She managed to make out the
name, but it might as well have been Greek.
She knew nothing of the town indicated three
miles beyond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apache,&#8221; she said desperately, &#8220;do you
know that it&#8217;s up to <i>you</i>?&#8221; Then she looked to
her saddle cinch and her stirrup straps, took the
little beast&#8217;s head in her arms and hugged him,
and kissed his velvety muzzle. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s up
to you. You&#8217;ve got to pull out for Woodbine
and Uncle Abel somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Perhaps Uncle Abel&#8217;s name was the pass
word. At any rate, Apache nuzzled Beverly,
neighed, pawed the ground impatiently, and
indicated in every possible way that he would
do all any horse could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right then. Now make good!&#8221; and with
a light spring she was again in the saddle.
</p>
<p>There is no time to dwell in detail upon that
dark, cold, terrible ride between Front Royal
and Luray. Beverly had never been so cold
in all her life. She let Apache choose his own
way, and take his own gait, which was now slow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and doubtful, and then like an arrow, as his
confidence grew. Luray was reached in time
and skirted, then all was plain sailing to Sprucy
Branch fourteen miles beyond. Apache had
often been to Luray and knew every inch of that
road, but Beverly was by that time nearly
numb from the cold. Then:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 auto;  text-align:center;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;As if he knew the terrible need,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He stretched away with the utmost speed.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Hills rose and fell, but his heart was gay</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>With <i>Woodbine</i> only eight miles away.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Three-thirty A. M. had just been struck by
the ship&#8217;s clock near the head of Admiral Seldon&#8217;s
bed, the &#8220;seven bells&#8221; rousing him
slightly. He had never ceased counting time
by &#8220;watches,&#8221; and as sure as &#8220;morning watch&#8221;
drew near he would waken. The habits of early
years are not readily forsaken.
</p>
<p>The faintest suggestion of dawn was visible
over the Blue Ridge when, instead of turning
over again and settling down for his last, snug
morning nap, the old gentleman started wide
awake and keenly alert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had he heard a horse neigh?&#8221; Impossible!
The stables were too far from his bedchamber
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
for any such sound to reach him. &#8220;Reckon I
must have been dreaming of Beverly and her
little skallawag,&#8221; he said softly, and was about
to settle down once more when a neigh, loud,
clear and insistent, pierced the crisp morning
air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the &mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; he cried, springing out of
bed with surprising agility for his years, and
switching on the electric lights. Hurrying to
the window which commanded the sweep of the
driveway he peered out. In the faint light the
indistinct outline of a horse was visible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now which of those young devils of colts
has escaped?&#8221; was his query, as he hastily
donned his clothes, and started down stairs.
</p>
<p>But that neigh had been heard by others also,
and as the Admiral reached the end of the hall
Mrs. Ashby came from her bedroom arrayed in
bath robe and bed slippers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord only knows. One of those confounded
colts broken loose I dare say, and if it
is I&#8217;ll crack Uncle Abel&#8217;s head for him,&#8221; and
away he hurried.
</p>
<p>But Uncle Abel, who possessed six instead of five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
senses, the sixth being &#8220;horse sense&#8221; had heard
that neigh, too, and the ceremony of his robing
requiring less time than the Admiral&#8217;s, he was
already speeding toward that sound as fast as
his old legs would carry him. As he turned the
corner of the house he was welcomed by a most
jubilant neigh, and the next second had reached
the steaming Apache, and exclaiming:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma Lawd-Gawd-A&#8217;mighty, what done happen!
Is dat yo&#8217;, Miss Bev&#8217;ly? Baby! Honey!
Is yo&#8217; daid?&#8221; for a rigid, unconscious little
figure was leaning forward with her arms clasped
tightly around the panting horse&#8217;s neck.
</p>
<p>Quicker than it takes to tell it Abel had unclasped
the clinging arms and was tenderly
lifting her from the horse&#8217;s back. At that
moment the Admiral burst through the big
front door and came striding across the lawn,
storming at each step:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You Abel! You old fool! How did that
horse break loose? How&mdash;&mdash;My God! Who is
that?&#8221; for he was now near enough to see the
three figures and to hear Abel&#8217;s sobs which
punctuated his words as he held the helpless
little figure in his arms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What has happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd only knows, Mars Athol. But he&#8217;p
me wid dis chile quick please sur. She lak ter
die ef we don&#8217; do some&#8217;n.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No need of that request. Relieved of his
precious burden, Apache sped away for the
stable, his duty faithfully performed. There
many willing hands cared for him while his
little mistress, the excitement, fatigue and cold
having completed Miss Woodhull&#8217;s cruel work,
was tenderly carried into the house by old Abel
and her uncle, the latter muttering:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some of that damned woman&#8217;s work! I
know it is, and I&#8217;ll bring the whole school down
about her ears unless I find out the truth of it
all. My little girl! My little girl! Over thirty-five
miles in the dead of night, alone and nearly
frozen. Mary! Mary! Mammy! Everybody
come quick and phone for Doctor Marshall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Beverly was not dying, and within an
hour, under her mother&#8217;s and good old Mammy
Riah&#8217;s ministrations, was warm and snug in her
bed, though weak and exhausted. When the
doctor came he ordered absolute quiet and undisturbed
rest. &#8220;She will soon drop off to sleep,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
and let her sleep for hours if she can. She is
utterly worn out and as much from nerve strain
as physical fatigue if I know anything of symptoms.
What happened, Seldon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The good Lord who brought her through it
only knows, for I don&#8217;t, though I mean to learn
as soon as that child is in a condition to tell me.
And then by the great guns something&#8217;s going
to let loose. I&#8217;ve talked with that stone image
of a woman at Leslie Manor and I know what it
can say. It isn&#8217;t a woman; It&#8217;s a blight upon
the sex: A freak: It&#8217;s <i>stone</i>, and when lightning
strikes stone something bursts to smithereens.
And by all that&#8217;s powerful the lightning&#8217;s
going to strike <i>this</i> time. Thirty-five miles all
alone in the dead of the night. Marshall I&#8217;m
all bowled over. Good Lord! Good Lord!&#8221;
The Admiral paced the library like a caged
lion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman without children is only half a
woman,&#8221; sputtered fat little Doctor Marshall.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in again toward evening. Don&#8217;t worry
about her, for she&#8217;ll come out all right. She
has a constitution like India rubber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well may the Lord help that old maid if she
doesn&#8217;t!&#8221; was the Admiral&#8217;s significant answer.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>WHEN THE LIGHTNING STRUCK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up Bev! You&#8217;ll be late for breakfast.
You&#8217;ve done some sleeping since ten o&#8217;clock last
night,&#8221; called Sally, pounding upon the door of
bedroom A, but getting no response.
</p>
<p>Aileen had already knocked and called without
eliciting a reply, and both the girls were worried
but tried not to show it. When ten more
minutes passed in silence Aileen looked troubled
and asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think she is ill? Ought we to call
Miss Stetson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stetson!&#8221; snapped Sally. &#8220;If she is
ill she would rather see the old Nick himself
than Miss Stetson. I&#8217;ll run and get Mrs. Bonnell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of her anxiety Aileen laughed. True
enough, Miss Stetson was not exactly the person
to call in when one was ill. &#8220;That&#8217;s true, Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
Bonnell will be the one to call. But I wish
Bev <i>would</i> answer. It scares me almost to
death. And I&#8217;d like right well to know what
happened last night. Beverly Ashby is not the
sort of girl to go up in the air over nothing, believe
me, but she was pretty high up last night.
Do go for Bonny, Sally. I&#8217;m too nervous to
wait another minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and away sped Sally down the
corridor. As she reached the foot of the stairs
she almost ran into Wesley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has yo&#8217; heard what done happen las&#8217; night,
Miss Sally?&#8221; he asked excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What was it?&#8221; asked Sally eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Bev&#8217;ly&#8217;s hawse done been stole f&#8217;om
de stable; saddle, bridle an&#8217; all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas ma&#8217;am, dey done been! Jeff&#8217;son yonder
in de study a-tellin&#8217; Miss Woodhull &#8217;bout it
right dis minute,&#8221; and Wesley hurried away to
the dining room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apache stolen! Oh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Sally gasped. She
recalled the words which Beverly had spoken
the very first hour of their acquaintance: &#8220;It
would take very little to make me light out for
Woodbine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Six months had passed since those words had
been spoken, and during those months Beverly
had known some lonely hours as well as happy
ones; she had been made miserable more than
once by Miss Bayliss, Miss Stetson and Miss
Woodhull, who seemed to have conceived a
most unmerited dislike for the girl. Sally knew
nothing of Miss Woodhull&#8217;s dislike for Admiral
Seldon because he had presumed to question
her policy, nor could a girl of Sally&#8217;s sweet
nature possibly understand the smallness of one
which would take out upon a defenceless young
girl the resentment which she harbored toward
her older relative. Nevertheless, that was precisely
the situation, and Miss Stetson and Miss
Bayliss were Miss Woodhull&#8217;s mirrors.
</p>
<p>Sally soon found Mrs. Bonnell and together
they hurried up stairs. But Mrs. Bonnell was
no more successful in getting a response to her
calls than the girls had been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally, can you climb?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Bonnell,&#8221; answered Sally wholly
bewildered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then crawl through your window and along
the roof to Beverly&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not going to stir up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
a fuss unless I am compelled to. Look in and
tell me what you see. Be careful, dear,&#8221; she
ended as Sally scuttled over the window sill.
They leaned out to watch her. She gave a little
cry when she discovered that the room was
empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they asked in a breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she isn&#8217;t there at all,&#8221; gasped Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not there! Raise the window and go in
and unfasten the door, Sally. Be quick for the
breakfast bell will ring in a few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally did as bidden. The room was as undisturbed
as it had been twelve hours before.
</p>
<p>Aileen ran to the closet. &#8220;Her riding things
are gone!&#8221; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Wesley just told me that Apache had
been stolen in the night,&#8221; wailed Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is more to this than we thought,&#8221;
said Mrs. Bonnell considerably perturbed.
&#8220;Now I <i>must</i> report to Miss Woodhull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned and hurried from the room but
had not gone ten steps down the corridor when
she met that lady with wrath and fire in her eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this fresh annoyance concerning
Beverly Ashby? Jefferson has just told me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
that her horse was stolen in the night. A likely
story! It is some new deception upon her part.
Such duplicity it has never been my misfortune
to encounter. I wish to speak to her at once,&#8221;
stormed the principal, striding into the study.
</p>
<p>Now to be responsible for a young girl not
yet sixteen years of age, and one whose family
is widely known throughout the entire state,
and to discover that said young lady has been
missing from beneath one&#8217;s roof all night, is, to
say the least, disconcerting. For the first time
in her domineering life the Empress was thoroughly
alarmed. Alarmed for Beverly&#8217;s safety,
the reputation of the school, and, last, but by no
means least, for what such a denouement might
bring to pass in the future financial outlook for
her business. The school had paid well, but
how long would its patronage continue if the
facts of this case became widely known?
</p>
<p>Miss Woodhull was an alien in the land of her
adoption. She had never tried to be anything
else. She had established herself at Leslie
Manor because she wished to acquire health and
wealth, and she had achieved her objects to a
wonderful degree. But she had made no friends.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
She did not wish to make friends among the
Southerners. She despised them and all their
customs, and though in the beginning they had
made many gracious overtures of friendship she
had repulsed them at every turn. Consequently
they soon began to regard her with indifference
if not with contempt. There was absolutely
nothing in common between them. She was
merely a business proposition in their midst.
Their children could acquire beneath her roof
the education they desired for them, and there
it ended. If, as rumor stated, she really came
of gentle Northern blood it must have received
a very peculiar infusion in her immediate forebears.
They missed something of the noblesse
oblige which was to them as a matter of course.
So with each passing year the gulf had imperceptibly
widened until Miss Woodhull was
as much alone in hospitable Virginia as though
she lived in Borneo.
</p>
<p>Upon realizing that Beverly was really missing
her first impulse was to phone to Kilton Hall,
for, of course, she had risen early and rushed off
to see Athol. Miss Woodhull&#8217;s blood boiled at
the thought! Kilton Hall of all places the one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
she detested most. It had been a thorn in her
flesh from the moment she knew of its existence
for its policy was diametrically opposed to her
own. Still, inquiries must be made without
further delay, but she would be discreet. So she
called the school up by phone:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had they seen anything of a stray horse?
One of her pupil&#8217;s horses had escaped during
the night and she was phoning in every direction
in her endeavors to find it. It was Miss Ashby&#8217;s
horse and he might have made his way as far
as the hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there was no stray animal there, but
Dr. Kilton would have a thorough search made
in their neighborhood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Dr. Kilton was a far cry from being a fool.
Why should Miss Woodhull think a runaway
horse had run all that distance? And if he <i>had</i>
Dr. Kilton was fully convinced that he had not
run riderless. He had not forgotten that October
runaway. Moreover, he had detected a repressed
excitement in the voice over that phone.
He very quietly conferred with Mrs. Kilton
and that lady was quite as quick-witted as her
spouse. They decided to maintain a discreet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
silence, but to make some quiet inquiries. A
few hours later Smedes, the Doctor&#8217;s body
servant, was sent upon an errand to the little
village nearest Leslie Manor, and Smedes knew
every servant at that school. When he returned
Dr. and Mrs. Kilton became considerably wiser
regarding the true facts of the case, but decided
to say nothing to Beverly&#8217;s brother for the
present. But they kept in constant communication
with Leslie Manor, via Smedes and Jefferson.
</p>
<p>Far and wide did Leslie Manor send messages
and messengers. No horse was to be found. In
the school chaos reigned, and the usual Sunday
decorum and peace went by the board completely.
Some of the girls were rebellious, some
hysterical, some scolded and some wept silently,
and to a unit they all blamed Miss Woodhull
for the situation. Mrs. Bonnell and several
of the teachers were wholly indignant that she
had not instantly communicated with Beverly&#8217;s
family, as was obviously her duty. Mrs. Bonnell
openly urged it. Miss Woodhull pooh-poohed
the idea. &#8220;Beverly would come back
when she recovered from her fit of sulks, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
would be properly punished for her conduct by
expulsion. She had already transgressed to a
degree to warrant it, and had been warned the
evening before to that effect. (&#8220;Ah,&#8221; breathed
Mrs. Bonnell at this admission). Communicate
with Beverly&#8217;s people? Absurd! Why magnify
such a trivial matter? Girls had made believe
to run away from the school before, and would
doubtless do so again. They invariably ran
back again and Beverly would do likewise when
she got ready. She was probably with some
friend in the neighborhood. She was in the
habit of forming friendships with all sorts and
conditions of people. That her horse was also
gone might be a mere coincidence, or else she
was trying to frighten them all, and would come
riding back by sundown. She was capable of
almost any insubordination, and rising at dawn
and riding off somewhere was merely a fresh
demonstration of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That Miss Woodhull was merely &#8220;whistling
to keep her courage up&#8221; all well knew.
</p>
<p>But sunset failed to bring the runaway, and
Kilton Hall knew of this fact right speedily.
Then Athol was called to the Doctor&#8217;s study and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
the facts told him. The boy was thunderstruck,
and blurted out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that old harridan!&#8221; then blushed crimson.
Dr. and Mrs. Kilton did not reprove the
outbreak, but pardoned it upon the ground of
excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would better call up your uncle at once,
Athol. I do not wish to interfere, or criticise,
but I know what I should wish if it were my
daughter,&#8221; said Mrs. Kilton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much, Mrs. Kilton, I&#8217;ll
do it right off,&#8221; and he hurried into the little
room at the end of the hall where the phone
stood, Mrs. Kilton following, while the Doctor
wondered what the next move must be. A
moment later he joined them. Athol soon had
Woodbine on the wire and then ensued a funny,
one-sided conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Athol, is that you?&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Say, have you,&mdash;that is,&mdash;has Bev sent any
message to you today? What! She&#8217;s there, in
bed? Great Scott! When did she come?&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Three-thirty this morning on Apache? And
all in? Gee! But she&#8217;s all right now? You
have just been hearing the whole story from her?
She did those thirty-five miles in three hours?
Jimminy Christmas! Say, she&#8217;s a pippin! Bully
girl! I knew that pie-face over at her school
would queer the whole show. Say, Uncle Ath,
I&#8217;d just like to put one over on her for fair.
What did she do to Bev, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;She never! What, told her she <i>lied</i>!&#8221;
Athol very nearly kicked over the little phone
stand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Bev wouldn&#8217;t stand for it and lit out?
Snappy work! I say, Uncle Ath, let me come
home, please, and hear all about it. I&#8217;ll blow
up if you don&#8217;t say yes, honest, I shall. The
Doctor won&#8217;t let me? You bet he will. He
and Mrs. Kilton are right here beside me and
almost dancing up and down. They&#8217;re peaches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon!&#8221; he jerked over his
shoulder. &#8220;But they are all right. They&#8217;ve
been almost worried to death. They heard of it
early this morning and wanted to get word to
you right off, but didn&#8217;t dare butt in, you
see....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they have just said I may come and
I&#8217;ll be down on the first train in the morning.
I mustn&#8217;t say a word to <i>Arch</i>. Oh, Uncle Ath!
Well, I won&#8217;t if you say not but I reckon I&#8217;ll
burst if I don&#8217;t tell him. You don&#8217;t want the
old maid to get wise that Bev&#8217;s at Woodbine?
Going to give her a little dose of discipline?
Oh, I say, Uncle Ath, give her all that&#8217;s coming
to her. She rates it all right, all right. She&#8217;s
made things just too darned hot for Bev, and a
whole bunch of the girls up there. Everybody
hates her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; as Mrs. Kilton&#8217;s hand was laid warningly
upon his shoulder. Dr. Kilton had turned
hastily away. He could not trust his countenance,
nor did he wish to hear too much. The
boy which had never died in him was rebelling
in sympathy with Athol.
</p>
<p>A few more sentences and Athol hung up the
receiver, and sought the Doctor. He was boiling
with rage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brace up, old chap. It&#8217;s nothing serious,
you may be sure of that, or your uncle would
have sent for you at once. And, remember,
mum&#8217;s the word.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I&#8217;ll remember, sir. And thank
you a whole lot, sir, for letting me phone. I&#8217;ll
hold my jaw&mdash;I mean I won&#8217;t say a single word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty state of things, I&#8217;ll be bound,&#8221;
stormed Dr. Kilton when Athol had gone.
&#8220;Why that woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he did not complete
his sentence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she would sell out and go to live in
Jericho, or some other remote place!&#8221; cried Mrs.
Kilton, petulantly. Then added eagerly: &#8220;Oh
Avary, perhaps she will&mdash;after all this. It will
stir the whole countryside.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>FOR HAPPIER DAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>While Athol was fuming at Kilton Hall and
trying to keep his promise to his uncle to &#8220;hold
his jaw,&#8221; though it very nearly resulted in lockjaw,
the ferment at Leslie Manor grew.
</p>
<p>The older girls had grown rebellious almost to
a unit, and the entire school was terror-stricken
or hysterical, the inevitable outcome of a discipline
which had steadily grown more severe
and arbitrary; a nagging surveillance which
only incited in the pupils a wild desire to do the
very things of which they were unjustly suspected
and accused. They were never trusted,
their simplest, most innocent acts were misconstrued,
their word doubted, and, as in Beverly&#8217;s
case, Miss Woodhull had more than once
cruelly baited and insulted them.
</p>
<p>Truly, &#8220;the years had wrought strangenesses in
her,&#8221; and a more short-sighted policy than she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
had adopted for the past five it would be hard
to conceive.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnell and some of the teachers had
been painfully alive to all this for a long time.
Two or three of the instructors had resigned
and sought positions elsewhere, unable to work
in the unhappy atmosphere which Miss Woodhull
created.
</p>
<p>Once Mrs. Bonnell had bearded the lioness
in her den and striven to remonstrate with her,
which had drawn upon her devoted head such a
storm of resentment that she had then and
there tendered her resignation also. At that
point Miss Woodhull, realizing how entirely
dependent she was upon Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s perfect
management of Leslie Manor had actually
apologized and begged Mrs. Bonnell to remain.
She excused her language upon the score of excessive
fatigue after so many years of unremitting
work. &#8220;Unremitting?&#8221; Mrs. Bonnell
smiled but accepted the apology. Her livelihood
depended upon her own work, and she
also loved the place and had many friends in
that part of the world. But the idea of Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s &#8220;arduous work&#8221; was certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
amusing. Miss Woodhull never did a thing
(but criticise) from one day&#8217;s end to the next. She
had long since given up all classes, and now
merely presided as the autocrat of the establishment,
unloved by any, feared by many, disliked
by all. If Miss Stetson and Miss Baylis really
did like her they also shared the fear she inspired.
</p>
<p>More than one upheaval had occurred in the
course of the school&#8217;s existence, but had always
been quickly hushed up, though vague rumors
had circulated throughout the community. During
later years, however, more than one girl
had &#8220;been dismissed,&#8221; so Miss Woodhull stated,
&#8220;for unbecoming conduct.&#8221; The girls themselves
told different stories. For the past three
years Dr. and Mrs. Kilton had been quietly
trying to purchase Leslie Manor through agents
in Richmond, for a good bit of inside information
had come to them regarding the manner in
which matters were shaping there, and their
pride in the community, and in Warren County,
shrank from some possible crisis which would
bring upon it an unpleasant notoriety.
</p>
<p>In one sense the girls in Leslie Manor were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
well cared for. Their physical and personal
welfare were safe in Mrs. Bonnell&#8217;s hands and
the instruction was thorough and excellent. But
in the wise development of character, in the
trustful, happy confidence which girlhood should
know, in the harmony which is girlhood&#8217;s right,
or the harmless frolicing, and healthful bodily
development from spontaneous activities, they
were sadly lacking. Everything was cut and
dried. All things ordered from Miss Woodhull&#8217;s
austere standpoint. No wonder that the school
harbored &#8220;Pettys&#8221; and &#8220;Eleanors&#8221; and &#8220;Electras&#8221;
and a few other oddities. Until this year
it had never sheltered a &#8220;Beverly,&#8221; and this
same Beverly was likely to prove, though with
no such intention upon her part, its Waterloo.
</p>
<p>And thus stood affairs that Sunday evening
after Beverly&#8217;s flight, and then from a source
least expected Bomb Number 1 was hurled.
</p>
<p>All day long Electra Sanderson had been
strangely silent. At eight o&#8217;clock she marched
down to Miss Woodhull&#8217;s study, rapped upon
the door, and was bidden enter. That lady sat
with her hand upon the telephone receiver,
about to remove it. She now fully realized that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Admiral Seldon must be communicated with at
once. She must face the music this time. She
almost hailed Electra with joy as the source
of a brief respite.
</p>
<p>Electra crossed the room, rested one hand
upon the corner of Miss Woodhull&#8217;s desk,
plucked up her courage and plunged in head
first:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You scolded Beverly Ashby for receivin&#8217; a
letter she didn&#8217;t <i>get</i>. It wasn&#8217;t hers at all. It
was Petty Gaylord&#8217;s. I saw her receive it. I
don&#8217;t want to tell tales, but I <i>wont</i> have Beverly
blamed for something she never done&mdash;<i>did</i>.
She&#8217;s always been nice and polite to me and
Petty aint been. Eleanor Allen <i>stole</i> that letter
and brought it down here to you just to get
Beverly into trouble. I <i>saw</i> her do it. She
took it right out of Beverly&#8217;s history book.
Petty dropped it in history class and never knew
what had become of it. The next morning
Beverly came into our room and told Petty that
she had picked it up to return it to her but when
she opened her book to get it it was gone, but
Petty wouldn&#8217;t believe her and said awful things
to her till Beverly just looked at her the way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
she <i>can</i> look when she <i>despises</i> people (well Miss
Woodhull knew that look) and went out of the
room. But Eleanor had that letter all the time,
&#8217;cause I saw her sneak into Beverly&#8217;s room and
snitch it. I don&#8217;t know what she wanted with
it, but after I saw her take it I watched her
every single minute. I thought she would give
it to Petty, of course, they&#8217;re so stuck on each
other, but she didn&#8217;t. She just kept and kept
it for some mucker trick, and when I saw her
comin&#8217; down to your study last night I knew just
as well as anything what she was up to. She
hates Beverly just because she won&#8217;t have anything
to do with her and laughs at Petty and
her mash. Petty&#8217;s just dead in love with that
feller at Annapolis. Now if you don&#8217;t believe
what I&#8217;ve told you you can just send for both
of them and ask them yourself. I don&#8217;t care a
cent what you do for I&#8217;m going to leave this
hateful school tomorrow and you can&#8217;t stop me.
And I&#8217;ll tell dad all about this fracas too. I
hate you and everything in the school&mdash;so
there, now!&#8221; and with this final explosion
Eleanor turned and fled from the room. Erin
Go Bra! If Eleanor&#8217;s story had not collapsed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Miss Woodhull her English certainly would
have compassed that result. She fell back
upon her chair panting. Just then her phone
rang: BOMB No. 2.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Admiral Seldon, your niece is not here
this evening. She is temporarily absent. When
do I expect her to return? Oh, er&mdash;I think by
tomorrow at latest. Is she where you can communicate
with her by phone? Oh, certainly,
certainly. The number? Why, er, I must
ascertain for you. You must know immediately?
You have heard alarming rumors? Ridiculous!
Your niece missing since last evening? Preposterous!
Absurd! Yes, of course, if you insist.
And you will be over by the first train
in the morning? Really, you are over-solicitous.
My pupils are well looked after and cared for.
You have reason to believe they are? Your
tone hardly bears out your statement. She
must be here to receive you when you arrive?
Oh, certainly. <i>Very</i> well. Good-by.&#8221; The
Empress came nearer fainting after that conversation
than she had ever come in all her life.
</p>
<p>But such a nature as hers must have a vent
for its spleen, and what better ones than Eleanor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and Petty, the cause of all the mischief? The
electric bell which summoned them to Miss
Woodhull&#8217;s study fairly sputtered sparks.
Eleanor was sulkily silent. Petty, as usual, in
tears. Tears were Petty&#8217;s long suit.
</p>
<p>We have not time to dwell upon the details
of that interview even if we would. Eleanor
was one of the few girls to really be expelled
from the school, and Petty promptly fled to
&#8220;darling mamma&#8221; and &#8220;Reggie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Early Monday morning Admiral Seldon arrived
upon the scene and was closeted with the
Empress for two solid hours. This time his
guns were <i>not</i> silenced, and those passing the
study door could hear a steady rumble like heavy
firing afar off, and in the intervals lighter shots,
as though a gatling gun were popping its stacatto
fire. Ultimately the heavy gun silenced the
gatling. The last shot was something upon this
order:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your methods, Madam, may prevail elsewhere,
but permit me to say that they are a
dead failure here. You are not training cart
horses, but thoroughbreds, and you can&#8217;t lash
and spur <i>that</i> breed. No, my niece will <i>never</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
return to Leslie Manor while it continues under
its present management, and the next time I
select a school for her the character and personality
of its head will influence my choice far
more than the curriculum, or modern methods.
We have managed in bygone days to produce
some pretty fine specimens of the true gentlewoman
by the old methods in vogue in this part
of the United States, and I am hopeful that we
may produce a few more before the race dies
out. Yes, I assuredly advise a rest, Madam,
and that you prolong it indefinitely. It will
benefit you immensely, I am sure&mdash;and also a
great many others. I have the honor to wish
you good-morning. And you need feel no further
concern regarding my niece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The following week the Easter recess began.
During that recess Miss Woodhull went to a
famous Sanitarium in the state in order to
&#8220;Restore her over-taxed nerves.&#8221; She did not
know that the physician in charge was one of
Admiral Seldon&#8217;s oldest friends. He strongly
advised against resuming her duties after the
Easter recess, and urged her to discontinue all
work (?) for at least a year, and to seek an entire
change of scene.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>She followed his advice so far as change of
scene was concerned, but her idea of a complete
rest was an immediate and very active affiliation
with her suffering sisters in a crusade for their
&#8220;rights,&#8221; and the overthrow of the oppression
of the sterner sex. She sailed for England, and
once in London became one of the most rampant
of the wronged ones.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the school was being conducted by
Miss Baylis, who for five blissful weeks reigned
supreme, while &#8220;hope&#8221; hinted a permanent
one. But, alas! nothing is so delusive as human
hope. That city across the sea settled Miss
Baylis&#8217; plans, and Miss Woodhull&#8217;s future.
That lady had found her true place among
England&#8217;s &#8220;gentlewomen&#8221;(?), though she had
utterly failed to do so among Virginia&#8217;s. Over
there she could chuck books at the heads of
dignified judges and glory in seeing the old
gentlemen dodge. She could heave her shoes
at the Chancellor, and shout and yell with her
wronged sisters. She could smash windows,
blow up people&#8217;s houses, arrange and cavort
with the maddest of her feminine friends, and
give a glorious vent to all the long pent-up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
belligerence in her makeup, to the everlasting
humiliation, mortification, shame and horror
of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>gentlewomen</span> of her own land. Exit
Miss Woodhull.
</p>
<p>And her substitute? Her triumph was short
lived. Leslie Manor was sold in May. Agents
in Richmond conducted the sale. No one knew
the purchaser, but during the following month
workmen appeared as by magic and labored
like gnomes all day, and almost all night too.
New buildings were erected, all sorts of strange
changes made in the old ones. The place assumed
huge proportions. What could it all
mean?
</p>
<p>In August the cat popped out of the bag. Dr.
and Mrs. Kilton moved in. A new and imposing
sign appeared upon the handsome iron grill-work
of the entrance gate, the gold letters reading:
&#8220;The Wilder-Kilton Co-Educational Academy!&#8221;
Wilder had been Mrs. Kilton&#8217;s maiden
name. Old Kilton Hall, long since out-grown,
became the home farm, and a sort of retreat for
any pupils who were ailing or in need of a complete
rest. The school was to be opened September
thirtieth, under an entirely new auspices,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and certainly under very new conditions. It
was a daring venture, a complete innovation,
but Dr. and Mrs. Kilton were sanguine of success.
Whether their dreams were realized or
not must be told in &#8220;A Dixie Girl Co-Ed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And down in Woodbine?
</p>
<p>Well, three hilarious young people were nearly
tearing the world to tatters in their joy. In
May Admiral Seldon had taken them to Washington
and Annapolis, where they had, sure
enough, had the time of their lives. Then, the
sight-seeing fever increasing, Mrs. Ashby joined
them in Philadelphia, and away they went to
New York, Niagara, and finally to Europe,
where the summer was spent in one round of
ecstasy. And now September was drawing to
its close, and with the last day of that month
their eagerly-longed for co-ed days would begin.
